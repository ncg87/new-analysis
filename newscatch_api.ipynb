       "   'summary': \"The Bitcoin price recently rallied above $72,000 for the first time since March. According to data from CoinGecko, the Bitcoin price rallied by about 12% last week to reach an intraday high of $73,295 on October 29, which put it only 0.6% away from reaching a new all-time high.\\nThe recent Bitcoin price surge has not only reignited more interest in the cryptocurrency but has also created a bullish ripple effect across the industry and the Dogecoin price has emerged as a standout. Interestingly, the ongoing presale of the Ethereum token,\\nhas also attracted significant interest as investors look to position themselves for 800x gains amidst the bullish sentiment in the Bitcoin price.\\nBitcoin Price Rally Sparks Bullish Ripple Effect On Ethereum Token WallitIQ (WLTQ)\\nThe recent breakout of the Bitcoin price above the $72,000 threshold has created a bullish ripple effect and a fear-of-missing-out (FOMO) environment among crypto enthusiasts, prompting many investors to look towards the ongoing WallitIQ presale. Consequently, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is poised for extraordinary growth in its price, with expectations of 800x gains following its official launch.\\nHowever, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is not just another Ethereum token. It is an AI utility Ethereum token designed to fulfill various roles within and beyond the WallitIQ platform.

The Dogecoin price experienced a remarkable rally alongside the\\nin the last few days in October, which allowed it to outperform many other cryptocurrencies, especially those with large market caps.\\nAside from the bullish ripple effect from the Bitcoin price rally, the Dogecoin price has also garnered attention among meme coin investors due to its association with US election campaigns and Elon Musk's newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, abbreviated as DOGE. This renewed interest has amplified the momentum behind the Dogecoin price, setting the stage for a potential new high in 2024. This could even possibly fuel a new all-time high for the Dogecoin price if the current trend continues.\\nConclusion\\nIn conclusion, both the Dogecoin price and the\\nEthereum token have had the best bullish ripple effects from the recent surge in Bitcoin price.

       "   'excerpt': 'As Bitcoin reaches new highs, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Tron, and Minotaurus (MTAUR) show upside potential. Explore why these altcoins are worth watching.',\n",
       "   'summary': \"As Bitcoin reaches new highs and the overall outlook seems very positive, the altcoin market is heating up. Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Tron (TRX), and Minotaurus (MTAUR) are gaining attention as they may also see bigger moves.\\nIn this article, we'll look at why these cryptocurrencies are worth watching. We'll check their price movements and see if they have the potential to reach new highs like Bitcoin. Ethereum (ETH): Powering the Next Wave of Blockchain Innovation\\nThe first altcoin to mention is Ethereum. It has a major role in the crypto world. It supports many decentralized applications (DApps), smart contracts, and NFTs. With more than 3,500 decentralized applications on its blockchain and over 70% of the NFT market, it has shown both strength and stability. The recent rise in Bitcoin has led to more focus on Ethereum, which is now expected to see a price rise as well. Ethereum's network processes about 1.2 million transactions each day, which shows how widely it is used. With this solid foundation, ethereum price USD may continue to rise as interest in crypto grows.\\nThe Ethereum price is now between $2,787.50 and $2,947.84, while its all-time high (ATH) sits at $4,878.26. Current market indicators suggest that Ethereum could soon be on a path to test and potentially pass this ATH. The RSI is at 68.2, nearing overbought levels, indicating high demand, and the MACD at 51.3 supports this strong trend. If Ethereum breaks through its immediate resistance of $2,989.5, a move toward its ATH could soon follow, setting ETH up for new records. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Community-Driven Contender\\nThe second pick, Dogecoin, started as a 'meme coin,' but it has since grown into a popular crypto asset with major support from well-known figures and a strong community. Dogecoin is known for its fast transactions and low fees. In fact, it processes transactions 60 times faster than Bitcoin and completes 10,000 transactions every minute. It has a large user base, with over 2 million active wallets worldwide. As Bitcoin's upward trend sparks interest in other coins, the Dogecoin stock may also attract new buyers, especially given its loyal following.\\nCurrently, the Dogecoin price ranges from $0.1867 to $0.1978, far below its ATH of $0.7316. Technical indicators suggest that Dogecoin is gaining momentum. With the 10-day moving average at $0.171478 showing a positive trend and an RSI at 73.6, Doge is in high demand and close to its first resistance level of $0.193380. A strong break above this level could push Doge past $0.225580 and drive it toward its ATH. The strength of its community, renewed interest in altcoins, and recent positive coverage might just help Doge aim for a return to these previous highs. Tron (TRX): A Fast and Affordable Blockchain Alternative\\nNext up, we've got Tron and Tron is known as a solid option for decentralized applications, focusing on low fees and fast transactions. It currently supports over 1.8 billion transactions and has more than 200 DApps. Tron is also popular, with over 130 million user accounts on its blockchain. This broad reach and growing network make trx tron a reliable choice for developers. As Bitcoin's rise brings attention to altcoins, trx coin could attract more users who want low-cost transactions.\\nThe trx price is now between $0.1598 to $0.1617, compared to its ATH of $0.2317. The 10-day moving average of $0.164233 shows TRX is consolidating at this level. The support level for TRX is $0.157458, while the next resistance levels are $0.174653 and $0.181089. Technical signs, including an RSI of 47.49 and Williams Percent Range of -90.2, indicate TRX is currently oversold. This could lead to a bounce in price, and if TRX breaks above $0.174653, it may aim to test and even surpass its ATH, especially as demand for affordable blockchain solutions grows. Minotaurus (MTAUR): 70% Price Slash, 234% Growth Ahead!\\nAfter covering the big players, it's time to check out the little-known contenders. Minotaurus (MTAUR) is creating a huge buzz in the gaming world, and there's still time to jump on board. The presale price is only 0.00005979 USDT, which is a massive 70% off the future listing price of 0.00020 USDT. Early buyers could see a 234% increase in value once MTAUR lists!\\nThe token has incredible utility—players use MTAUR to unlock exclusive in-game features and get an advantage. But that's not all. Holders also enjoy referral bonuses when they bring in friends, plus bonuses for those who lock their tokens through vesting. The excitement is palpable, with influencers getting involved and the community growing every day. Plus, don't miss your chance to enter the 100,000 USDT giveaway, with 50,000 USDT in MTAUR up for grabs. Act fast — tokens are running out, and the price won't stay this low forever! Conclusion\\nBitcoin's rise has opened the door for altcoins like Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Tron to follow its success. Ethereum price USD could be primed to surpass its ATH of $4,878.26 with its strong network and high demand. Doge price, driven by a strong community and renewed interest, may also target its ATH of $0.7316. TRX coin, with its low-cost network, has the potential to reach its ATH of $0.2317 as more users seek affordable blockchain options.\\nBut, today's standout is none other than Minotaurus (MTAUR). The entry price is super low, but the potential is massive. There are great perks for holders and an exciting giveaway to top it all off. Don't miss your chance to be an early bird!\\nLearn more about Minotaurus:\\nVisit the Minotaurus Presale Page\\nSubscribe to the Announcements Channel\\nJoin the Community on Telegram\\nFollow Minotaurus on X (Twitter)\",\n",

       "   'summary': 'Dogecoin, a popular meme-based coin, has recorded a spike, having its value rise by 12% within the last 24 hours. Some of the increase is attributed to the upcoming announcement of the U.S. presidential elections, with the market anticipating a Republican win to boost the cryptocurrency market. Dogecoin has risen by 65% since the start of October and could still rise further depending on which way the election outcome, according to analysts.\\nMaster Kenobi, an independent crypto analyst, has stated that Dogecoin is \"strategically positioned\" for the U.S. presidential election results. Historical data shows Dogecoin oscillating within an ascending channel since early 2017, suggesting a pattern of significant rallies post-major crypto events like the Bitcoin halving.\\nImpact of Political Developments on DOGE\\nThe correlation between political events and cryptocurrency pricing is becoming increasingly evident. Dogecoin, particularly, has responded to the U.S. election cycle with substantial price movements. Analysts predict a 30% price increase should Donald Trump secure the presidency, mirroring similar crypto market responses to global political shifts.\\nMoreover, the involvement of high-profile endorsements, such as Elon Musk\\'s advocacy for Dogecoin through social media and public engagements, continues to influence its market position. Musk\\'s proposal to establish a \"Department of Government Efficiency,\" humorously acronymised as D.O.G.E, has also sparked interest among investors, aligning with a surge in new Dogecoin addresses, which doubled in late October.\\nTechnical Indicators and Market Sentiments\\nFrom a technical standpoint, Dogecoin\\'s daily trading patterns are beginning to reflect investor optimism for a Republican victory in the elections. The cryptocurrency outperformed major players like Bitcoin and Ethereum in early November. If Dogecoin closes above the resistance level of $0.174, it could climb by 35% to reach near yearly highs of $0.23.\\nAdditionally, a golden cross on\\nweekly chart, a bullish indicator last seen in 2020 leading to unprecedented gains, suggests potential for substantial long-term growth. This setup forecasts a possible repeat of the massive returns experienced in 2021, reinforcing the optimistic outlook for Dogecoin as the political landscape unfolds.',\n",

       "   'summary': \"Bitcoin surged to a new record high of $75,060 as traders and investors bet on a potential Trump victory, with many speculating that a Trump administration would bring crypto-friendly policies. Ethereum and Dogecoin also saw significant gains, jumping 6.5% and 18%, respectively. Experts believe a shift in regulatory stance under Trump could benefit the crypto industry, with promises to make the US a global crypto hub and create a Bitcoin reserve. Bitcoin's market cap hits $1.445 trillion, and analysts predict it could reach $80,000 to $90,000 by Inauguration Day. Some even forecast Bitcoin could hit $100,000 before the year-end, with projections of $200,000 by 2025 driven by macroeconomic factors. Watch the full coverage on Business Today TV.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Crypto Price Today: The cryptocurrency market is witnessing interesting developments as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other prominent digital assets exhibit varied performance. A potential weekly bull flag setup may emerge, adding excitement to the market as the world awaits the U.S. presidential election results. Bitcoin's transaction volume reached an all-time high in October, exceeding 20 million, highlighting strong network activity.\\nBitcoin (BTC) Analysis\\nCurrent Price\\n: $68,440\\n24-Hour Change\\n: -0.79%\\n7-Day Change\\n: -3.55%\\nhovers around $68,440, experiencing a slight dip over the past day and week. The chart shows Bitcoin fluctuating within the Bollinger Bands, indicating potential volatility ahead. The price remains close to the upper Bollinger Band, suggesting a possible upward momentum if buying pressure continues. The 20-day simple moving average (SMA) serves as a midline, with recent price action oscillating around this level, hinting at consolidation.\\nIn the broader weekly context, the formation of a bull flag is evident, implying potential upward movement. With heightened interest around the U.S. election, Bitcoin may attract additional trading activity, possibly driving its price further.\\nEthereum (ETH) Analysis\\nCurrent Price\\n: $2,426.47\\n24-Hour Change\\n: -1.64%\\n7-Day Change\\n: -7.41%\\nEthereum's performance reflects a decline, with a 1.64% drop in the last 24 hours and a steeper 7.41% decrease over the past week. The chart shows\\ntrading below the 50 on the Relative Strength Index (RSI), indicating neutral to slight bearish sentiment. The RSI, currently at 52.76, suggests that Ethereum is neither overbought nor oversold, though it remains close to a support level, which could trigger renewed buying interest.\\nEthereum's price trajectory mirrors Bitcoin's consolidation pattern, although it has shown more pronounced downward movement. Traders may watch for a potential recovery as Ethereum approaches its support zones, which could attract buying activity.\\nKey Market Movers and Sector Overview\\nA closer look at notable gainers and losers offers insights into market dynamics.\\nBiggest Gainers\\n1. Dogecoin (DOGE)\\n: $0.1625 (+7.79%)\\n2. Mog Coin (MOG)\\n: $0.051842 (+7.30%)\\n3. Shiba Inu (SHIB)\\n: $0.0000173 (+2.69%)\\n4. Bonk (BONK)\\n: $0.0000184 (+2.08%)\\n5. Monero (XMR)\\n: $160.40 (+2.08%)\\nleads the gainers list with a 7.79% increase, driven by renewed interest in meme coins. Shiba Inu also posted gains, reflecting continued enthusiasm in community-driven projects. Privacy-centric Monero remains strong, benefiting from increased demand for secure transactions.\\nBiggest Losers\\n1. THORChain (RUNE)\\n: $4.45 (-11.25%)\\n2. Pendle (PENDLE)\\n: $4.14 (-8.26%)\\n3. Toncoin (TON)\\n: $4.60 (-5.53%)\\n4. Popcat (POPCAT)\\n: $1.27 (-4.87%)\\n5. Kaia (KAIA)\\n: $0.1194 (-4.72%)\\nTHORChain experienced the steepest decline, with an 11.25% drop, followed by Pendle, which saw an 8.26% decrease. Market volatility and profit-taking may have contributed to these losses.\\nBroader Market Trends\\nThe cryptocurrency market's mixed performance indicates a period of consolidation. With the\\naround the corner, market sentiment may fluctuate, impacting asset prices. Key levels in Bitcoin and Ethereum could play pivotal roles in determining future market direction.\\nBitcoin's record-breaking transaction volume in October underscores the increasing usage of its network, potentially reinforcing its long-term value proposition. Altcoins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu continue to capture attention, highlighting the enduring popularity of community-driven assets.\\nPotential Scenarios and Indicators to Watch\\n1. Bitcoin's Weekly Bull Flag\\n: A breakout from the current bull flag pattern could push Bitcoin toward new highs, especially if trading volume surges.\\n2. Ethereum RSI Levels\\n: Ethereum's RSI levels suggest it may be nearing a support zone. Monitoring RSI movement could provide clues about potential rebounds.\\n3. Election-Related Volatility\\n: The U.S. election outcome could impact investor sentiment, possibly leading to increased trading volumes and price swings.\\nThe\\nremains dynamic, with traders closely watching for signals of breakout or further consolidation. Keeping an eye on major support and resistance levels across assets will be crucial in navigating the coming days.\",\n",

As we witness Bitcoin\\'s resilience and increasing appeal among investors, it reaffirms its position as a mainstream store of value and a powerful tool for those seeking financial autonomy, security, and wealth preservation. This new high signals accelerating demand for digital assets. As adoption continues to grow, Bitcoin\\'s impact on the global financial ecosystem will deepen, and at ZebPay, we look forward to catering to our customers\\' needs as they explore the vast potential of digital assets.\\'\\n\"Bitcoin has hit a new all-time high today above $75,000. The path to $100,000 is now set in this bull cycle. Key altcoins will catch up post Bitcoin\\'s rally and it will coincide with strong retail adoption similar to November 2021. This cycle is also unique in terms of memecoins - DOGE, SHIB, PEPE etc - doing better than other sets of altcoins, though we continue to advise caution for our investors,\" says Vikram Subburaj, CEO of Giottus.',\n",

       "   'summary': \"The crypto market came to life late on Tuesday as it became clear President Trump would win the election. It was likely that either candidate would have been good for the crypto industry, which has led to a rise in crypto values this year, but this may have been a best-case scenario for policy changes.\\nBitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) was the biggest winner from a valuation perspective, climbing 11.3% in the past week as of 3 p.m. ET to a $1.52 trillion market cap. But Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) was up 18%, and Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) jumped 22.6% in that time, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.\\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free »\\nThe election and policy changes ahead\\nThe last four years have been frustrating for cryptocurrency enthusiasts and developers because the regulatory environment has been uncertain, at best. Instead of outlining clear rules, both Congress and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have left rules in a gray area and only enforced with legal charges once companies release products.\\nThat's the lack of clarity companies have been talking about, and it's possible that changes. On the SEC level, Chair Gary Gensler will likely be replaced quickly after Trump takes office, and that will change the enforcement environment almost immediately. Rule changes will take time, but that will also follow.\\nIt also looks like Republicans will control both houses of Congress, which means both political appointments and laws can be passed that may favor the industry. We don't know what that looks like yet, but innovation won't happen without some kind of clarity.\\nInvestors bet big on crypto\\nThe SEC did allow Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs earlier this year, and in less than 36 hours, the Bitcoin ETFs alone saw $1.3 billion of inflows after the election. Those inflows were part of the price increase through simple supply and demand.\\nWe may see even more ETFs if the regulatory environment changes, which could bring even more inflows.\\nElon Musk and the Dogecoin pop\\nWhen it comes to Dogecoin, there's speculation that Elon Musk's involvement in the campaign could lead to some kind of value for the token. That's a long shot, but it's the kind of speculation that's commonplace in the market today.\\nThis was the biggest meme coin to pop, but it wasn't the only one, with many smaller tokens rising double digits this week.\\nWhere does crypto go from here?\\nWhile the increase in values makes some sense if there are regulatory changes, it doesn't mean the increase will last. A lot of the advances in crypto over the past two years weren't with tokens -- it was with the underlying blockchain and stablecoins used for transactions. Even native tokens may not generate value if stablecoins are what we use for transactions.\\nStory Continues\\nI think there's a bright future for the blockchain, but the companies building blockchain technology will be the beneficiaries. Speculating on tokens probably won't last, just as we saw in 2022, when a frothy market ended badly for crypto investors. Don't miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

       "   'summary': \"Cryptocurrencies are on a rally, with Bitcoin (BTC) hitting an all-time high on Wednesday morning, amid reports of Donald Trump making major gains in the U.S. Presidential election. Bitcoin crossed the $75,000 mark hours after the nation went to polls to elect the 47th president.\\nThe Bitcoin rally has been gaining pace over the past month after the Federal Reserve announced its first interest rate cut in four years. Investors are optimistic about another rate cut at the end of the Federal Reserve's November policy meeting on Thursday, which is likely to give the crypto market a further boost.\\nGiven this situation, investing in Bitcoin related stocks like NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. IBKR, BlackRock, Inc. BLK, Accenture plc ACN and CME Group Inc. CME, which have strong growth potential for the near term, would be a prudent choice.\\nBitcoin Hits All-Time High\\nBitcoin hit an all-time high of $75,011.06 on Wednesday, surpassing its previous high of $73,770 recorded in March. The cryptocurrency was last trading at 74,802, up 8.2% in the past 24 hours. The high came as millions of Americans came out to cast their votes to elect the nation's next president.\\nOther major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE) also surged on Tuesday. Ethereum, Cardano and Dogecoin jumped 6.6%, 8.8% and 18.8%, respectively. The cryptocurrency market cap surged to nearly $1.5 trillion hours after polling opened.\\nBitcoin Rally to Continue\\nBitcoin has performed well lately, driven by institutional investments and increasing mainstream acceptance. Bitcoin ETFs have attracted more than $50 billion in inflows, which has helped create a solid base for Bitcoin's recent price changes.\\nBitcoin is often linked to Trump's campaign because of his strong advocacy for digital assets. He has even pledged to turn the United States into the global hub for cryptocurrency.\\nThe Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis points in September, giving a major boost to cryptocurrencies. Since then, Bitcoin has been on a strong rally. Market participants are now confident that the Federal Reserve will announce another 25 basis-point interest rate cut at the end of its November policy meeting this week, which could further fuel the ongoing rally.\\nAlso, market analysts predict that Bitcoin could exceed $80,000 by the end of November, regardless of the election results.\\nBitcoin Related Stocks With Upside\\nNVIDIA Corporation\\nNVIDIA Corporation is a major player in the semiconductor industry and has been one of the standout success stories of 2023. As a leading designer of graphic processing units (GPUs), the value of the NVDA stock tends to surge in a thriving crypto market. This is primarily due to the crucial role that GPUs play in data centers, artificial intelligence, and the mining or production of cryptocurrencies.\\nStory Continues\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"As the next crypto bull run approaches, all eyes are on the big names—Solana, Dogecoin, Kaspa, and Ethereum—to see how they'll perform. Each of these coins brings something unique to the table, from Solana's high-speed transactions to Dogecoin's surprising popularity boost. Meanwhile, the up-and-coming altcoin\\nis shaking things up with features like a Zero-Gas protocol and exciting Social-Fi staking. As news breaks about Donald Trump's election victory, the crypto markets are rapidly surging.\\nSo, who's going to win before the year ends? Here's a look at each Solana, Dogecoin, Kaspa, Ethereum, and JetBolt's latest developments, performance, and the market's sentiment heading into 2025.\\nSolana's Steady Ascent\\nSolana is currently trading around $186.94, after a massive 15% jump in the last 24 hours. However,\\npopularity remains a hot topic, fueled by its various decentralized finance platforms (DeFi) and a rapidly expanding decentralized application (DApp) ecosystem.\\nRaydium, for example, is helping Solana close in on Ethereum's numbers for transaction volume and daily active users. While Solana processes up to 50,000 transactions per second with low fees, Ethereum currently manages around 30 transactions per second, often at higher costs. These differences make Solana appealing to users seeking faster, more affordable transactions as Ethereum continues working on upgrades to boost its scalability.\\nAnalysts believe Solana's commitment to high-speed performance and low fees gives it staying power, especially as more users and developers seek efficient, cost-effective networks. However, with other projects offering unique features, Solana's future success could depend on how well it differentiates itself in the crowded DeFi landscape.\\nDogecoin's Surprising Surge\\nDogecoin (DOGE) is currently priced at around $0.20, with a notable 18% increase that has surprised even its loyal community. Engagements on social media from various crypto icons as of late have given DOGE an unexpected push.\\nMany in the crypto community see Dogecoin's recent uptick as a reflection of its loyal fanbase and US election hype. Dogecoin's recent rise highlights its loyal fanbase and appeal as a microtransaction-friendly currency, ideal for small in-game purchases like character customizations or loot boxes. With low fees and fast processing, DOGE has become a niche payment solution, especially for younger crypto enthusiasts.\\nAlthough it lacks the utility of some of its counterparts, Dogecoin's strong brand and community engagement keep it in the spotlight—proving that sometimes community enthusiasm alone could drive demand.\\nKaspa's Impressive Transaction Volume\\nKaspa (KAS) is trading at approximately $0.12, up 14% in just one day, and is gaining attention due to a remarkable surge in transaction volume. On October 22, 2024, Kaspa processed over 15.79 million transactions in a single day, surpassing major proof-of-work networks like Bitcoin and Dogecoin.\\nKaspa's success lies in its design as a high-throughput blockchain, focusing on scalability without compromising security or decentralization. The coin's increase in activity has drawn interest from developers and investors looking for high-performance blockchain solutions. Many KAS holders may see this feat as a sign that Kaspa could attract more decentralized applications and potentially expand its ecosystem.\\nEthereum's Strategic Purge Update\\nEthereum (ETH), valued at around $2,600, recently saw a 3.65% increase today as it rolled out 'The Purge' update. This strategic update aims to tackle Ethereum's network bloat by removing unnecessary data and streamlining protocol processes. The goal is to improve the efficiency and scalability of Ethereum's blockchain, making it easier for developers and validators to participate without high storage costs.\\nEven as Ethereum focuses on scalability improvements, crypto whales have been spotted looking for fresh, new opportunities like JetBolt this month.\\nJetBolt's Zero-Gas Tech and Growing Appeal to Crypto Whales\\nWhile established cryptocurrencies continue to push for efficiency and scalability, JetBolt (JBOLT) is making waves with a fresh approach that's attracting both seasoned whales and crypto buyers. Since its presale in August 2024, JetBolt has sold over 41 million tokens worth $468,000. A growing number of crypto whales have been spotted acquiring JetBolt tokens due to the network's gas-free transactions, AI features, and socially connected staking.\\nJetBolt's\\n, which removes gas fees entirely, is a major selling point for its token holders. On legacy altcoins, high gas fees can be a significant barrier, especially for users making frequent or smaller transactions, as these costs add up quickly. JetBolt offers an affordable and user-friendly experience, making it a standout for whales looking for crypto coins that won't break the bank.\\nBuyers will also have access to JetBolt's AI-powered dashboard that showcases blockchain news and updates. For crypto enthusiasts who want to stay updated without constantly checking the market, this attribute adds a cutting-edge feature we rarely see on new altcoins.\\nAn exciting social twist lies in JetBolt: a staking program that boosts crypto rewards by inviting friends and contacts to join the platform. This SocialFi approach creates a community-focused staking experience, aligning with Web3's vision of collaborative growth.\\nWith additional incentives like\\n, which offer up to 25% bonus tokens for early coin buyers, JetBolt could be the next leading-edge altcoin for those looking beyond traditional players in the crypto market.\\nConclusion: Established and New Coins like Solana, Dogecoin, Kaspa, Ethereum, and JetBolt Kick Into Overdrive For 2025\\nWith the crypto market heading into a potential new post election bull run, well-established players like Solana, Ethereum, Kaspa, and even meme-favorite Dogecoin continue to showcase their distinct strengths. Solana and Ethereum work to improve scalability and transaction speeds. On the other hand, Dogecoin maintains its loyal community appeal, and Kaspa boasts its high transaction volumes daily.\\nHowever, JetBolt's recent surge in interest and impressive presale—selling over 41 million tokens—reveals growing demand for fresh, innovative platforms. As this new token attracts a mix of crypto whales and enthusiasts, JetBolt's unique features position it as a trailblazing altcoin for those looking to engage with the next wave of blockchain evolution.\\nLearn More About JetBolt:\\nOfficial Website:\\nTelegram Channel:\\nX/Twitter:\\nDisclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not offer financial advice.

Bitcoin ETFs have recorded $1.4 billion in inflows, bringing the total inflows to over $25 billion this year.\\nThis trend indicates genuine buying interest, with Bitcoin spot ETFs alone seeing $5.1 billion in inflows. Low funding rates suggest this influx is largely from long-only buyers, leading to a potential squeeze in Bitcoin.\\nThe demand for calls over puts on Bitcoin reflects strong bullish sentiment.\\n'Bitcoin Skew, the spread between implied volatility for puts versus calls, continues to fall, reflecting stronger demand for upside exposure over concerns about downside risk,' the report states.\\nBitcoin's volatility dynamics could shift as spot ETFs gain prominence, possibly leading investors toward higher-beta cryptocurrencies like Ethereum.\\nMeanwhile, the report identifies an uptick in retail trading activity in South Korea, with tokens like UXLINK UXLINK/USD seeing substantial trading volume.\\nAs the token outpaced popular cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin DOGE/USD and Bitcoin on Korean exchanges, it reflects a renewed interest among retail traders and adds a layer of volatility to the market landscape.\\nThis rally is unfolding amid institutional inflows and increased interest in core cryptocurrencies.\\n10x Research suggests that as institutional mandates expand, attention will likely consolidate around major cryptocurrencies, notably Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana.\\nThese assets are not only leading the market but are also positioned to drive the crypto market cap to new highs.\\nWhat's Next: For further exploration of these trends and strategies, Benzinga's Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19 will bring together industry leaders to discuss the future of cryptocurrency investments amidst regulatory shifts and market changes.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"The launch and popularity of exchange-traded funds for different cryptocurrencies have become a hot topic for investors and analysts. It has also raised speculation for imitative interest in other leading coins like Ripple, Solana, and Dogecoin due to the success of Bitcoin. An ETF approval should allow institutional investors and greater market actors to invest in these assets, thereby pushing demand and, consequently, the prices of these tokens. Recently, Ripple's CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, hinted at the inevitability of an XRP ETF, as many crypto enthusiasts and experts believe such regulatory moves will completely alter the market structure. While XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin ETFs are potential market movers and no action is currently funneled toward their direction, analysts project that a little-known competitor, Rexas Finance (RXS), could surpass them all. Rexas Finance is the best opportunity in the crypto market, set up for significant expansion through its unique tokenization of real-world assets. Now, let's focus on analyzing the relationship between the ETFs' approvals and the prices of the major cryptocurrencies, as well as the factors influencing the remarkable growth of Rexas Finance. Solana (SOL): The Outlook of a Solana ETF\\nThe crypto market continues to dominate and Solana trades around $175.28 as of now. The enhanced transaction times, comparatively low fees, and extensive adoption of the crypto make it an appealing option for a potential ETF. Should a Solana ETF get the green light, certain estimations indicate a price of $2,000 may be within reach as soon as early 2026, with a possible 15x increase. This approval would instill a great deal of confidence in the market, enabling institutional investors to commit to Solana in a compliant manner. This would give the required momentum to Solana, and its capital reserves would aid in competing with Ethereum, the leading competitor in smart contracts and decentralized applications. It would also increase Solana's liquidity and expand its network of projects, making it attractive to investors looking for alternatives to high Ethereum fees. Ripple (XRP): How Traditional Investment Might Be Useful for X20 Growth in Ripple ETFs\\nXRP has been considered an asset with great potential, especially as it is designed as a bridge currency for international transactions. According to Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple's CEO, there are high hopes for the approval of a Ripple ETF, which may allow XRP to become integrated into investment funds easily. Currently trading at prices below a dollar, this currency is expected to perform well, and, according to some analysts, could achieve a price increase of up to 20x, which could push it to double digits down the road, depending on whether an ETF is granted. This would benchmark the growth of the currency, as it would permit a wider range of financial institutions to include XRP in their arsenal. These developments would lead to an increase in the liquidity of XRP, price fluctuations would be lessened, and therefore the best place for long-term investors. Dogecoin (DOGE): Positive Outlook Amid Bullish Sentiments\\nOriginally considered a meme coin, Dogecoin has developed an audience and major market interest. While a Dogecoin ETF may be more in the realm of 'will not' than 'could', the acceptance of ETFs based on more established assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum may pave the way for Dogecoin to gain acceptance. Meanwhile, the popularity of Dogecoin, as well as its active communities, could lead to a bullish effect on prices, especially with ETF approval, as that could mean large buy-ins and endorsements from industry companies. Certainly, Dogecoin's path is more fickle, but the possibility of quick realizations cannot be ignored if the crypto industry moves toward a more bullish regulatory scenario. Rexas Finance (RXS): Positioned for 19,000x Growth Potential\\nWhile Solana, Ripple, and Dogecoin capture the most attention, Rexas Finance, also referred to as RXS, is rapidly gaining popularity and looks poised for significant growth in the market. Unlike most crypto projects, Rexas Finance focuses on real-world asset tokenization, allowing investors to own fractional shares in assets like properties, precious metals, and other commodities. The platform includes the Rexas Token Builder, Launchpad, and Estate, among other features, making it easier to integrate tokenized assets into a blockchain framework. These characteristics allow investors to diversify their portfolios with asset classes previously out of reach.\\nThe presale of Rexas Finance has also been popular, with Stage 4 95% complete and over $5.1 million raised. The tokens are currently going for $0.060; however, with demand increasing, the price in the upcoming stage will rise to $0.070. In addition to the presale of tokens exceeding expectations, Rexas Finance has launched a million-dollar giveaway campaign focused on early adopters. Transitioning into the second phase and set to be listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, Rexas Finance will be positioned to reach a wider audience. Conclusion: The Solana, XRP, Dogecoin, and Rexas Finance Price Forecast for the Coming Months\\nIf Solana, Ripple, and Dogecoin each have unique features, the times when ETFs for these assets become available would change the entire landscape regarding institutional and retail investors' ability to invest soundly. That said, Rexas Finance is different as it stretches the limits of virtual currencies. Should Rexas Finance achieve its expected future development, it may transform everything known about assets and take crypto investing beyond typical paradigms. As these assets seek ways to capture the greatest market share, RXS stands out as an asset centered on innovation, offering a unique approach to investors looking for disruptive solutions within the crypto market.\\nAbout Rexas Finance :-\\nWebsite: https://rexas.com\",\n",

Bearing an acronym that mirrors Dogecoin's ticker name, the world's richest man has also expressed a sense of amusement toward the would-be agency's growing media coverage.\\nEven though Musk's D.O.G.E. remarks have brought fresh visibility to the $22 billion meme coin, the asset's bump in price has also coincided with 'renewed appetite for risk assets,' according to Ryze Labs investment analyst Noah Roy. In a statement, he described post-election positioning and the Federal Reserve's easing campaign as factors driving the asset's rally.\\n'As Bitcoin continues to trend up, this 'risk-on' environment is spilling over into altcoins like Dogecoin,' he said, adding that it underscores 'a wider enthusiasm in the digital assets space.'\\nThe Republican candidate has staged a full-throated endorsement of crypto on the campaign trail, promising to turn America into a crypto superpower while Vice President Kamala Harris has called for a regulatory framework . If Trump is reelected, then Dogecoin's ticker name could become a part of the Executive Branch under Musk for years to come.\\nLike most meme coins, Dogecoin's price has been especially volatile as the 2024 race enters its most pivotal stretch. Following Musk's government spending talk last week, the asset's price spiked as high as $0.178, representing its highest price since April.\\nOn Friday, Musk's would-be agency received support from a former professional football player with ties to Pennsylvania, a key battleground state. Former Pittsburgh Steelers player Antonio Brown said on Twitter (aka X) that he's 'joining the team'—the D.O.G.E. team, that is. On Musk's platform, Brown's post was viewed more than 40 million times.\\nThough Dogecoin has been riding higher on Musk's involvement in the 2024 race, his comments haven't always benefited the coin. After cheerleading Dogecoin to astronomical heights in 2021, the asset's price plummeted following its mention on 'Saturday Night Live' when Musk hosted.\\nAfter Musk famously conceded on the late night comedy show that Dogecoin is a 'hustle,' the asset's price fell sharply from an all-time high of $0.73. Though Musk said he's not ' actively involved ' in crypto earlier this month, Dogecoin's price could face volatility again on Musk's comments—depending on the election's outcome.\\nEdited by Andrew Hayward Start every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.\",\n",

Ethereum jumped 6.5%, and Dogecoin, often promoted by Trump supporter Elon Musk, rocketed 18% read more\\nIn a lively start to the Asian trading day, Bitcoin surged to a new record, reaching $75,060, as investors speculated on the possibility of Donald Trump returning to the White House. The world's most prominent cryptocurrency jumped 7 per cent, outpacing its previous high from March, with many seeing a potential Trump administration as a boon for crypto-friendly regulations.\\nThe early projections showed Trump leading in several states. Although the results are still unfolding, the market moved quickly, with investors anticipating that Trump's victory might mean looser crypto regulations, spurring excitement among traders.\\nAdvertisement\\nExperts believe the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could see a shift in attitude under Trump, which would benefit crypto innovation. Matthew Dibb from Astronaut Capital mentioned that while a Harris win might have tempered enthusiasm, markets are heavily weighing Trump's potential influence.\\nOther digital assets enjoyed the rally too.\\nEthereum jumped 6.5 per cent, and Dogecoin, often promoted by Trump supporter Elon Musk, rocketed 18 per cent. Cosmo Jiang from Pantera pointed out that Dogecoin's association with Musk has likely helped boost its appeal during this election period.\\nThe crypto industry itself has found its way into political discussions, with Bitcoin being viewed as a 'Trump trade' due to Trump's outspoken support. His promises to make the US the world's crypto hub, create a Bitcoin reserve, and bring in pro-crypto regulators have endeared him to the digital-asset community. Harris, in contrast, supports more regulation, proposing a balanced framework rather than sweeping deregulation.\\nVolatility expected\\nWith the election too close to call, traders are preparing for a volatile market. A spike in Bitcoin's volatility gauge suggests major price swings could be on the way. Orbit Markets indicated that Bitcoin might see up to an 8 per cent move in either direction, a stark contrast to its usual daily fluctuations.\\nSpot-Bitcoin ETF holders took a cautious stance, pulling a record $579.5 million from 12 funds the day before the election, as tracked by Bloomberg. Despite this, Bitcoin's value has soared over 70 per cent this year, fuelled by ETF inflows from major players like BlackRock and Fidelity.\\nHopeful Signs for Crypto Industry\\nCrypto executives anticipate that Trump or Harris will bring a friendlier tone to the sector than the Biden administration's crackdown. Critics argue that the SEC, under Gary Gensler, has opted for enforcement over a clear legal framework, dampening the industry's growth. With Trump or Harris, the sector may find itself in a more accommodating environment.\\nAdvertisement\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"The crypto market came to life late on Tuesday as it became clear President Trump would win the election. It was likely that either candidate would have been good for the crypto industry, which has led to a rise in crypto values this year, but this may have been a best-case scenario for policy changes.\\nBitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) was the biggest winner from a valuation perspective, climbing 11.3% in the past week as of 3 p.m. ET to a $1.52 trillion market cap. But Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) was up 18%, and Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) jumped 22.6% in that time, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.\\nThe last four years have been frustrating for cryptocurrency enthusiasts and developers because the regulatory environment has been uncertain, at best. Instead of outlining clear rules, both Congress and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have left rules in a gray area and only enforced with legal charges once companies release products.\\nThat's the lack of clarity companies have been talking about, and it's possible that changes. On the SEC level, Chair Gary Gensler will likely be replaced quickly after Trump takes office, and that will change the enforcement environment almost immediately. Rule changes will take time, but that will also follow.\\nIt also looks like Republicans will control both houses of Congress, which means both political appointments and laws can be passed that may favor the industry. We don't know what that looks like yet, but innovation won't happen without some kind of clarity.\\nThe SEC did allow Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs earlier this year, and in less than 36 hours, the Bitcoin ETFs alone saw $1.3 billion of inflows after the election. Those inflows were part of the price increase through simple supply and demand.\\nWe may see even more ETFs if the regulatory environment changes, which could bring even more inflows.\\nWhen it comes to Dogecoin, there's speculation that Elon Musk's involvement in the campaign could lead to some kind of value for the token. That's a long shot, but it's the kind of speculation that's commonplace in the market today.\\nThis was the biggest meme coin to pop, but it wasn't the only one, with many smaller tokens rising double digits this week.\\nWhile the increase in values makes some sense if there are regulatory changes, it doesn't mean the increase will last. A lot of the advances in crypto over the past two years weren't with tokens -- it was with the underlying blockchain and stablecoins used for transactions. Even native tokens may not generate value if stablecoins are what we use for transactions.\\nI think there's a bright future for the blockchain, but the companies building blockchain technology will be the beneficiaries. Speculating on tokens probably won't last, just as we saw in 2022, when a frothy market ended badly for crypto investors.\\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you'll want to hear this.\\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a 'Double Down' stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you're worried you've already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it's too late.

       "   'summary': \"Some low-cost cryptocurrencies have a high probability of exhibiting high growth and yield similar to leading currencies in the market today. In this article, we focus on three digital coins that are traded at less than one dollar and may bring good returns. These new cryptos may even have a chance to compete with or even supplant Solana and Cardano as the new leaders in the constantly changing crypto world. The question is; which one will gain more attention and be the next big contender in this promising trend?\\nDogecoin: From Memecoin to Market Contender\\nDogecoin (DOGE) was launched back in 2013 with the aim of adding fun to the world of crypto currency by using the face of the Shiba Inu dog as its mascot. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin has no maximum supply, 10k new coins are created every minute. Initially, DOGE was not viewed as a memecoin, however, by 2021 DOGE valuations rapidly increased meaning it was one of the ten largest cryptos with market capitalization over $50 billion. This growth was fueled by social media giants, such as the richest man in the world Elon Musk which shows that the community is valuable.\\nBuilt on technology that enables quick, low-cost transactions, Dogecoin maintains strong community support and visibility in today's market cycle. This is good news for investors who are looking for an easy-to-understand version of a cryptocurrency. It may survive as a niche product, that is still popular among people because of its accessibility and popularity. The Dogecoin experience thus demonstrates the role of community and culture in the development of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\\nShiba Inu (SHIB) Expanding Ecosystem\\nSHIBA INU launched in August 2020 and is inspired by the Dogecoin model and is built on the Ethereum blockchain. SHIB was created by an unknown developer named Ryoshi and the token supply at launch was one quadrillion. Half of them were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, a large portion of which he donated to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund, and he burnt 40% of the supply. This move gained a lot of attention and helped to define SHIB as one of the most famous 'memecoins' in the crypto space.\\nThanks to its Ethereum foundation, SHIB offers more utility beyond its original meme status. ShibaSwap is one of the applications it hosts, which is a decentralized exchange and will introduce a DAO governance system in the future along with an NFT marketplace. This Ethereum integration enhances SHIB's ecosystem, and therefore, investors who wish to invest in a diverse crypto market will be attracted to SHIB. Presently, the many uses of SHIB and the growing support from the community make it an interesting option for anyone in the market for newer cryptocurrencies.\\nDTX Token: Powering Utility and Rewards on the DTX Exchange\\nDTX Token is the backbone of the\\nand offers several functions that are critical within the network. As the exchange's indigenous cryptocurrency, DTX Tokens are utilized to offset trading charges, in some cases with a rebate to encourage the community's involvement. This encourages traders to use DTX Tokens to make cheap transactions thereby improving the trading experience while also increasing user interactions on the app.\\nBeyond trading discounts, holding DTX Tokens unlocks access to premium features on the DTX Exchange. By meeting certain holding requirements, users can access advanced tools like enhanced analytics and priority customer support. This rewards long-term holders and creates a loyalty-driven ecosystem, ensuring committed users benefit from exclusive services designed to improve their trading success.\\nDTX Token holders can also participate in governance by staking their tokens, gaining voting power in decisions that influence the platform's future. This, combined with the chance to invest in tokenized assets representing real-world financial instruments, broadens DTX's utility. Offering access to diverse markets, DTX Tokens enable users to explore new investment avenues, while contributing to the growth and direction of the exchange.\\nConclusion:\\nIn conclusion, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and\\neach present unique value propositions that set them apart in the competitive cryptocurrency landscape. Dogecoin's community strength, Shiba Inu's expanding ecosystem on the Ethereum blockchain, and DTX Token's integral role in the DTX Exchange create distinct advantages that appeal to diverse investor interests.\\nWith their potential to outperform prominent coins like Solana and Cardano, these affordable cryptocurrencies offer intriguing opportunities for growth. As the market continues to evolve, these emerging tokens could capture substantial attention, establishing themselves as potential frontrunners in the next wave of crypto innovation.\\nLearn more:\",\n",

       "   'excerpt': \"As each meme coin vies for the favorite spot in a very lucrative conversation, Shiba Inu (SHIB) vs Dogecoin (DOGE) is a battle that's entertained many in the\",\n",
       "   'summary': \"As each meme coin vies for the favorite spot in a very lucrative conversation, Shiba Inu (SHIB) vs Dogecoin (DOGE) is a battle that's entertained many in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Dogecoin today has managed to come back up by 80.17% after bottoming out in January at $0.074 and is currently hovering around $0.14. Although Dogecoin has recorded this inflow of cash, the meme coin market has not witnessed any indisputable alt season which begs the question of whether in the long term, should investors expect Shiba Inu to take over Dogecoin as the lead meme asset by the year 2025? Scrutinizing the sentiments in the market and the measures of profitability in the market explains the reason why you will always be better off with DOGE than SHIB. Profitability of Dogecoin Outshines Shiba Inu\\nBased on on-chain data indicating 52.21% of all DOGE holders—roughly 2.87 million wallets—are profitable, almost half of Dogecoin investors are now sitting on unrealized gains. Recent data from IntoTheBlock shows that 9.35% are breaking even and 38.45% are at a loss. This high proportion of prosperous DOGE holders not only shows fortitude against market swings but also improves community feeling. Profitability helps investor confidence, therefore lowering panic selling and promoting an accumulation process that drives prices higher.\\nShiba Inu's profitability measures, on the other hand, present a less hopeful image. While a startling 63.47% of holdings are underwater, just 29.79% of SHIB investors are now in the green. When most investors are in a loss position, it might generate selling pressure, therefore preventing the asset from rebounding as investors leave holdings to minimize losses. Given that Dogecoin keeps high liquidity and attracts long-term investors, the different parameters between DOGE and SHIB imply that it should keep its edge in the meme currency market entering 2025. Market Dynamics in Dogecoin's Advantage\\nDogecoin is clearly ready for a comeback according to current market trends. Due in great part to the enthusiasm surrounding a possible Bitcoin ETF approval, big cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Avalanche (AVAX) have dominated the conversation; meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have less prominence. But Dogecoin's quite high profitability rate puts it for a comeback as investors seek to diversify beyond blue-chip assets as liquidity starts to flow back to the meme coin market.\\nFurthermore, Dogecoin's continuous profitability and high community appeal help to explain why it is regarded as a dependable asset in the meme coin space. DOGE holders through market instability are currently profiting, and the steady demand of the asset points to future continuous expansion. Comparatively, Shiba Inu struggles mightily to win investor confidence and profitability, especially if it seeks to subvert Dogecoin's hegemony in the next bull run. Is Rexas Finance (RXS) a better substitute for Meme Coins?\\nRexas Finance (RXS) offers a convincing substitute for those looking for long-term value outside the memecoin buzz. Rexas Finance provides a platform anchored on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, so transcending speculation unlike Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. By allowing the tokenization of physical assets including real estate, commodities, and art, RXS exposes investors to a developing market bridging conventional finance and digital assets. By allowing fractional ownership of valuable assets, this technique makes them available to a larger audience and provides stability outside the volatility of meme coins. Rexas Finance entered the market at exactly the right moment. Demand for asset-backed tokens that offer liquidity and openness while serving both retail and institutional investors rises as distributed finance (DeFi) gets traction. Using Ethereum's strong infrastructure, Rexas Finance presents a scalable and safe solution. Underlying smart contracts, this infrastructure guarantees regulatory compliance and openness—qualities that appeal to investors looking for creativity without sacrificing confidence. The recent presale success of Rexas Finance shows increasing project interest. After generating more than $5.45 million in its fourth presale stage, RXS's consistent price increase points to a well-organized development strategy advantageous to early investors. With a goal listing price of $0.20 and a price now of $0.07 currently in its fifth stage, RXS may present a 500% return upon listing, a gain more than matched by DOGE and SHIB.\\nOriginal ideas drive the Rexas Ecosystem.\\nRexas Finance is a complete platform providing special goods to improve the digital asset ecosystem, not only another token on the market. Designed to simplify and increase blockchain acceptance, among its innovations are the GenAI for NFTs and the QuickMint Bot. Through messaging apps like Telegram and Discord, the QuickMint Bot lets users create and control tokens straightforwardly, therefore enabling even non-technical people to profit from tokenizing. Rexas Finance's GenAI also brings artificial intelligence to the NFT scene so consumers may make digital artwork with little work involved. This feature removes the obstacles to NFT development, therefore enabling a larger audience to access the digital art market—a field experiencing phenomenal expansion lately. These developments together build an ecosystem that appeals to a wide range of people, therefore establishing RXS as a flexible investment with actual value outside market speculation. Further setting Rexas Finance apart from Dogecoin and Shiba Inu is its $1 million giveaway campaign. Ahead of the token's public release, this campaign—which grants 20 winners $50,000 in RXS—is meant to increase community involvement and raise brand awareness. Rexas Finance creates a devoted user base most likely to support RXS's value in the long run by rewarding involvement and participation. Rexas Finance distinguishes itself from the meme coin space, where value is typically driven by hype rather than substance, with this strategic focus on community involvement and the tangible usefulness of the initiative. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu or Rexas Finance?\\nAlthough Shiba Inu and Dogecoin still rule the meme coin market, the main indicators point to Dogecoin having a better profitability stance. With over half of its investors in profit, Dogecoin seems more suited for those looking in the meme coin space to hold value and draw fresh purchasers. But Shiba Inu has a difficult climb to rebuild investor trust since its sizable underwater investment base reduces the possibility of increasing momentum. For those looking beyond the volatility of meme coins, Rexas Finance presents a more interesting substitute. Rexas Finance offers a consistent, scalable, compliant platform appealing to a wide spectrum of investors by using the real-world asset tokenizing trend. The successful presale of the project and its creative elements—the QuickMint Bot and GenAI—showcase its ability to change digital asset investment. As the terrain of cryptocurrencies changes, investors could find more success in initiatives with obvious use and a clear growth plan—qualities Rexas Finance reflects. For those ready to venture outside the meme coin fever, RXS offers a convincing investment choice that might surpass both Dogecoin and Shiba Inu in the next years.\\nAbout Rexas Finance :-\\nWebsite: https://rexas.com\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"The Dogecoin price is in the spotlight as DOGE bulls rally for a major leap. With an ambitious projection of a 2,500% surge, the DOGE bulls are pushing to contend for a top-five ranking. However, while the Dogecoin price has generated excitement, another DeFi token, ETFSwap (ETFS), is disrupting its buzz with a 17,000% projected ROI potential.\\nETFSwap's (ETFS) Soaring Returns Test DOGE Bulls' Confidence\\nDogecoin's (DOGE) loyal following, especially DOGE bulls, continue to watch with excitement as predictions of the Dogecoin price 2,500% increase permeate the cryptocurrency market. This is refreshing news for the community, as past Dogecoin price performances have significantly dampened investors' confidence.\\nFurthermore, volatility is an intrinsic feature of the cryptocurrency market. If the Dogecoin price can achieve more stability and align closely with Bitcoin's (BTC) trends, it could deliver a 2,500% increase, riding the wave of the broader cryptocurrency market trends. Therefore, DOGE bulls hold on to this possibility with optimism.\\nHowever, DOGE bulls are faced with a compelling investment opportunity in ETFSwap (ETFS). This Ethereum-based token is projected to produce a 17,000% ROI, far surpassing the returns of Dogecoin (DOGE). Hence, many DOGE bulls consider diversifying their portfolios to include ETFSwap (ETFS) as they wait for the Dogecoin price growth.\\nSmart Investments Start With ETFSwap (ETFS)\\nThe cryptocurrency industry is riddled with savvy investors who search for profitable innovation with radar precision. Often, ETFSwap (ETFS) catches their attention with its unique features. For instance, ETFSwap (ETFS) offers up-to-the-minute data on ETF performance, price movement, market trends, and sector analysis. This information could include personalised data feeds, price alerts, and market analysis tailored to the user's assets. Access to real-time insights empowers investors to make faster investment decisions, putting them ahead of market trends.\\nIn addition, ETFSwap (ETFS) integrates AI-powered tools to simplify users' interaction with the ETF market. With its sophisticated ETF Screening and filtering tools, ETFSwap (ETFS) helps users search for ETFs based on various parameters like risk level, yield, sector, etc. This assistive technology allows investors to hone in on specific characteristics of ETFs, suiting their portfolios more precisely, and exploring other niches and emerging markets that fit their trading strategies.\\nETFSwap (ETFS) has officially launched its beta phase 1 platform on the testnet, igniting significant excitement among crypto investors and market analysts. This release has driven high traffic of users to engage with the platform's primary digital asset, seizing the opportunity to participate in its early stages. The beta platform boasts of a sleek and accessible user interface that welcomes users with ease. Beneath the surface, it is grounded on a powerful and intricately designed backend infrastructure. This framework not only ensures reliability but also reveals ETFSwap's (ETFS) commitment to delivering a scalable experience for the crypto community.\\nAlthough the platform is built on the Ethereum blockchain, using smart contracts to execute transactions, the ETFSwap (ETFS) team did not skimp on the defences of their platform. To prove this, the team has completed a KYC verification for the platform by SolidProof, a smart contract auditing firm. Additionally, a security audit was conducted by CyberScope, a cybersecurity auditing firm, to find and fix all security vulnerabilities.\\nConclusion\\nThe Dogecoin price remains a central theme for investors, with DOGE bulls throttling harder for impressive gains. Yet, many DOGE bulls are starting to lose momentum, observing how better ETFSwap (ETFS) is doing in comparison to the Dogecoin price. Investors are still buying the ETFSwap (ETFS) token at $0.03846 and claiming a 50% discount by using the 'ETFS50' promo code.\\nFor more information about the ETFS Presale:\\nVisit ETFSwap Presale\\nJoin The ETFSwap Community\",\n",

Dogecoin: From Internet Meme to Crypto Market Influencer\\nDogecoin (DOGE) is a cryptocurrency that began in 2013 as a lighthearted take on digital coins, featuring a Shiba Inu dog from an internet meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, it has no cap on supply, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute, making it abundant. Initially considered a joke, Dogecoin's value soared in 2021, reaching over $50 billion in market capitalization, partly due to endorsements from figures like Elon Musk and a booming crypto market. Its potential lies in strong community support and social media presence. While its high supply could affect long-term value, Dogecoin continues to attract interest, and its role in the current market cycle depends on ongoing adoption and market trends. Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Utility\\nShiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency token inspired by Dogecoin but runs on the Ethereum blockchain. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous Ryoshi, it started with a supply of 1 quadrillion tokens. Half of these tokens were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin, who donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply. SHIB's operation on Ethereum allows for compatibility with decentralized applications like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. There are plans for a future NFT platform and a governance system based on a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). This integration could enhance SHIB's utility in the crypto space. Investors are watching its development in the current market cycle. Conclusion\\nIn the midst of the 2024 bull run, DOGE and SHIB show less short-term potential compared to Catzilla. Positioned as the ultimate meme coin hero, Catzilla aims to bring financial freedom to all. With a presale offering a 700% ROI potential, triple utility features, and a mission to unite enthusiasts, it invites participation in the battle against crypto villains.\\nSite: Catzilla ($CATZILLA)\\nTwitter: https://x.com/CatzillaToken\\nTelegram: Telegram Chat\\nTelegram News\\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.

       "   'summary': \"The Dogecoin price has experienced a massive pump , rising by a whopping 25% to lead current market gains. This notable increase comes on the heels of the United States Presidential election, where many crypto analysts view a potential Donald Trump win as an incredibly bullish outcome for the Dogecoin price. Moreover, Trump has publicly endorsed a new proposal by SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk to establish the Department of Governance Efficiency (D.O.G.E), fueling more positive market sentiment for the top meme coin. Dogecoin Price Soars 25% In One Day\\nIn the last 24 hours, the Dogecoin price has shocked the meme coin and broader crypto market with a considerable value surge. This top meme coin has climbed by a whopping 25% and is continuously growing.\\nThe rapid rise in the price of Dogecoin to the $0.2 milestone aligns with the recent uptick in the crypto market , as top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are also seeing a significant upsurge. A combination of investor optimism regarding the potential establishment of Musk's Department of Governance Efficiency and the US Presidential elections has led to the recent bullish sentiment and uptick in the Dogecoin price.\\nOn November 4, the crypto market was in a holding position, with investors taking on a wait-and-see approach ahead of the US Presidential election results. With early results already coming in, many investors have already predicted that a Trump win could lead to a significant bull run for Dogecoin.\\nThese predictions are grounded in the new crypto narrative, D.O.G.E, spearheaded by Musk . The Dogecoin meme coin is set to gain new significance, with many in the crypto community likening Musk's D.O.G.E acronym to reference the popular meme coin.\\nGiven the strong influence of social sentimen t and market trends on meme coins, many speculate that if Musk successfully establishes the Department Of Governance Efficiency with Trump's support, Dogecoin could become one of the official cryptocurrencies. Such a bullish move could lead to an unprecedented rally for the Dogecoin price. What A Trump Win Means For The Dogecoin Price\\nNumerous crypto analysts are betting big on the probability that a Trump win could lead to a significantly bullish outlook for the Dogecoin price. Notably, crypto analyst Shelby has disclosed on X (formerly Twitter) that DOGE has been showcasing strong performance and momentum recently, skyrocketing as though Trump has already won the US election .\\nHe predicts that if Trump wins the ongoing Presidential elections, the Dogecoin price could lead the meme coin market as it experiences a 'parabolic rally.' Similarly, a Dogecoin supporter on X, identified as 'Dogegod,' has projected that the price of the meme coin will reach the coveted $1 mark when Trump wins the US election. Source: X\\nNumerous crypto community members and analysts share this bullish sentiment, citing Musk's D.O.G.E proposal and Trump's endorsement as major catalysts for a Dogecoin bull run.

Despite individual declines, the global cryptocurrency market cap rose 0.36% over the past 24 hours, reaching around $2.26 trillion.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\'Bitcoin continues to face selling pressure as uncertainty increases with only hours remaining before the US election. Market sentiment has been impacted by factors like Trump\\'s declining odds, weak non-farm job data, and Mt.

BTC now faces resistance at $69,000, with strong support at $65,950,\" said Edul Patel CEO of Mudrex.Meanwhile, the CoinSwitch Markets Desk stated, \"Market volatility is high with the U.S. election voting and FOMC meeting this week. Historically, BTC tends to rally after election week, so current dips may just be noise.\"The volume of all stablecoins is now $79 billion, which is 95.19% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume, as per data available on CoinMarketCap.\\nADVERTISEMENT In the last 24 hours, the market cap of Bitcoin, the world\\'s largest cryptocurrency, fell to $1.358 trillion.

       "   'summary': \"A prominent cryptocurrency trader forecasts significant surges for Dogen and Dogecoin, hinting at substantial gains on the horizon. In contrast, another well-known meme coin might not fare as well. This intriguing outlook has the crypto world buzzing, leaving enthusiasts eager to learn which tokens are set to outshine the rest.

It's a deal that others will envy, and you'll be at the top of the pack. ⚡️Missed WIF, Popcat or Ponke rise?⚡️\\nDOGEN is the new doggie on the Solana memetokens ground alongside BONK, WIF, and Popcat known for their astonishing 1000% growth. Currently undervalued, DOGEN is poised to take this crypto narrative to the next level, potentially breaking records in this bull run.\\n🎉Community-Driven with Real Value🎉\\nDOGEN isn't just a short-lived hype; it's a growing movement.

Join the Dogen Army today and conquer the crypto world!🚀\\nDogecoin: A Meme-Based Cryptocurrency with Growing Influence\\nDogecoin (DOGE) is a cryptocurrency launched in 2013 as a lighthearted alternative to traditional digital coins. It features a Shiba Inu dog from an internet meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin has no maximum supply, and 10,000 new coins are mined every minute. Initially seen as a joke, it gained significant value in 2021, entering the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The surge was due to social media attention and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk. Dogecoin's community-driven approach shows the impact of social media on financial markets. Its potential lies in its strong following and easy accessibility. In the current market cycle, it remains an attractive option for those interested in popular cryptocurrencies. Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Expanding Utility\\nShiba Inu (SHIB) is an Ethereum-based memecoin inspired by Dogecoin. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous Ryoshi, it started with a quadrillion tokens, half of which were sent to Vitalik Buterin. Buterin donated a large portion to charity and burned 40% of the total supply, increasing SHIB's visibility. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB runs on Ethereum, enabling applications like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. Plans include a future NFT platform and a DAO-based governance system. SHIB's integration with Ethereum allows for broader utility. In the current market cycle, its expanding ecosystem and potential applications may make it an attractive option for those interested in memecoins with utility. Conclusion\\nWhile DOGE and SHIB may have less immediate potential, DOGEN stands out for those seeking success. With expected 700% growth by the end of presale and potential thousand-fold returns, DOGEN follows successful tokens like BONK and WIF. It is building a community of leaders and offers real benefits, including exclusive perks for early adopters.\\nSite: Dogen crypto\\nTwitter: https://x.com/dogenmeme\\nTelegram: https://t.me/Dogen_Portal\\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

       "   'summary': \"PERSONAL FINANCE INVESTING CURRENT PRICE OF BITCOIN: NOV. 7, 2024 Bitcoin remains the most popular cryptocurrency available to buy.\\nBitcoin is the original cryptocurrency and remains the most popular crypto coin on the market, with a market capitalization of over $1.1 trillion. Like other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin is vulnerable to extreme volatility and sudden price fluctuations. As of 9 a.m. Eastern time today, the price of Bitcoin (1 BTC) is $74,707.50, a difference of +0.92% from yesterday.\\nBitcoin price\\nPercentage change Price of Bitcoin yesterday $74,023.32 +0.92% Price of Bitcoin 1 month ago $62,098.69 +20.3% Price of Bitcoin 1 year ago $35,633.63 +109.65% Price of Bitcoin yesterday $74,023.32 +0.92% Price of Bitcoin 1 month ago $62,098.69 +20.3% Price of Bitcoin 1 year ago $35,633.63 +109.65%\\nBitcoin was originally envisioned as a technology for payments. Today, however, most people consider it to be an investment asset—something to save in a Bitcoin IRA, for example.\\nAs a decentralized, digital asset, the top cryptocurrency is a popular investment choice for people who want to add alternative assets to their portfolios. Many find cryptocurrency appealing as a hedge against inflation or as a way to better diversify their investments. Bitcoin has experienced astronomical growth and has outpaced recent gains on major stock market indices, making it an attractive alternative.\\nBitcoin is relatively young, especially in comparison to blue chip stocks like Pfizer, Nike, or Nestle. It was launched in 2009, and its price has skyrocketed.\\nIn 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz, a software developer and an early believer in Bitcoin's value, famously paid 10,000 Bitcoins for pizza. Today, those coins would be worth over $580 million.\\nSince then, Bitcoin's price has continued to climb. At the beginning of 2024, its price was $44,187. By March 2024, its price reached its highest level ever, surpassing $73,079.\\n'The potential benefits of investing in crypto are potentially higher returns than a more traditional stock and bond portfolio may yield on its own,' said Drew Feutz, a certified financial planner (CFP) with Migration Wealth Management.\\nHowever, Bitcoin often experiences price fluctuations and dips. As of September 2024, its price had dropped to about $58,000.\\nBitcoin's prices rise and fall for a number of reasons. While the price of stocks can fluctuate based on company performance or industry news, Bitcoin is affected by other factors: Bitcoin adoption: When a major company announces that it will begin accepting Bitcoin as a payment method, Bitcoin's price tends to increase. In the past, Bitcoin's price has increased significantly after companies Tesla, Ferrari, and Dell announced Bitcoin as an acceptable payment method.\\nWhen a major company announces that it will begin accepting Bitcoin as a payment method, Bitcoin's price tends to increase. In the past, Bitcoin's price has increased significantly after companies Tesla, Ferrari, and Dell announced Bitcoin as an acceptable payment method. Economic conditions: Generally, Bitcoin isn't affected as much by inflation or interest rate changes as stocks. However, cryptocurrencies usually perform well when the economy is in good shape. When people are relatively comfortable and feel confident in their financial stability, they're more willing to invest in alternative assets. When the economy is in decline, people take fewer risks and may decrease how much they invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\\nGenerally, Bitcoin isn't affected as much by inflation or interest rate changes as stocks.

When the economy is in decline, people take fewer risks and may decrease how much they invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Regulatory activity: Because cryptocurrency is so new, regulations haven't kept up. As the government outlines new laws and regulations, investors may become more wary of Bitcoin.\\nInvesting in Bitcoin can take different forms.\\nBuying Bitcoin directly is one of the most popular ways to invest in cryptocurrency. You can buy Bitcoin by opening an account with a cryptocurrency exchange. You can sync the account with your bank account and use your money to buy Bitcoin.\\nAnother way to invest in Bitcoin is to open a Bitcoin IRA. A Bitcoin IRA is a tax-advantaged retirement account that allows you to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin IRAs have the same tax benefits and contribution limits as traditional or Roth IRAs, but you can invest in alternative assets.\\nA relatively new way to invest in Bitcoin is through a crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF). With these ETFs, you don't directly own Bitcoin, but the performance of the ETF will reflect Bitcoin's performance.\\nCrypto ETFs allow you to buy and sell shares through an investment brokerage account, without the need to worry about storage for cryptocurrency or opening a separate cryptocurrency exchange account.\\nFor those wary of investing directly in Bitcoin, another option is to invest in cryptocurrency-focused stocks. Potential options include publicly traded cryptocurrency exchanges, technology firms, and payment processors; these companies may use Bitcoin or use it in their operations, so you'll indirectly benefit from Bitcoin's performance.\\nBitcoin is still a relatively new asset, but it has displayed impressive past performance, and more and more companies are using it or accepting it as a payment method. As Bitcoin becomes more established, it may experience fewer fluctuations in price too.\\n'Bitcoin's price volatility is steadily decreasing over the years,' said Brady Swenson, co-founder and head of product marketing at Swan Bitcoin. 'As a far more liquid asset, its price volatility is lower than relatively illiquid cryptos.'\\nIf you plan on holding onto your investment for the long haul, investing money into Bitcoin could be a good choice.\\n'It's always a good time to invest in Bitcoin with a long-time horizon, [such as] 10 or more years,' said Swenson. 'Cryptos are for gambling, not investing.'\\nAlthough Bitcoin is the most well-known cryptocurrency, it's not the only investment option you have. When deciding where to invest your money, consider these alternatives: Cryptocurrency Price per coin Bitcoin $74,707.50 Ethereum $2,807.50 Tether (USDT) $1.00 Binance Coin (BNB) $590.83 Bitcoin $74,707.50 Ethereum $2,807.50 Tether (USDT) $1.00 Binance Coin (BNB) $590.83 Ethereum: After Bitcoin, Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum wasn't created to serve primarily as currency. Instead, it was designed as a decentralized computing platform, and it's a popular tool for developers.\\nAfter Bitcoin, Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum wasn't created to serve primarily as currency. Instead, it was designed as a decentralized computing platform, and it's a popular tool for developers. Tether: Tether is a stablecoin, meaning its value is tied to another asset. In Tether's case, its value is linked to the United States dollar. As a result, Tether tends to be less volatile than Bitcoin, but that also means it lacks Bitcoin's growth.\\nTether is a stablecoin, meaning its value is tied to another asset. In Tether's case, its value is linked to the United States dollar. As a result, Tether tends to be less volatile than Bitcoin, but that also means it lacks Bitcoin's growth. Binance Coin: Binance Coin is a cryptocurrency that you can use on the Binance exchange ─ the largest cryptocurrency exchange based on trading volume. It can be used to buy other forms of cryptocurrency, pay Binance fees, or for payment processing.\\nDespite some severe dips, Bitcoin's performance has been impressive. Over the past 15 years, Bitcoin's price has skyrocketed and, as companies adapt to the technology and it's a more commonly accepted payment method, there's the potential for even more growth.\\nHowever, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin can be volatile and risky. Since Bitcoin is so new, it's hard to gauge how it will truly perform over the long term. Only invest what you don't need in the short term and diversify your portfolio so that the performance of your other investments can reduce the impact of Bitcoin's price fluctuations.\\n'[I suggest] keeping their crypto position to 5% or less of their overall portfolio,' said Feutz.\\nAlthough Bitcoin is fairly young, its performance over the past 15 years has been impressive. Over the past five years, its price has increased by over 450%. To put that performance in perspective, consider that the S&P 500 ─ a stock market index that tracks the performance of 500 of the largest companies in the U.S. ─ increased by about 85% over the same period.\\nYou can use your Bitcoin holdings in several ways: Sell it for cash: If you sell your Bitcoin holdings, you can get cash that you can transfer to your bank account (or invest in other assets).\\nIf you sell your Bitcoin holdings, you can get cash that you can transfer to your bank account (or invest in other assets). Trade it for other coins or tokens: If you hold Bitcoin, you can trade your Bitcoin for other forms of cryptocurrency, such as Ethereum or Dogecoin.\\nIf you hold Bitcoin, you can trade your Bitcoin for other forms of cryptocurrency, such as Ethereum or Dogecoin. Pay for purchases: Some companies allow you to use Bitcoin as a payment method. You can use your holdings to book hotel stays, purchase a new computer, or cover a restaurant bill.\\nTo start investing in Bitcoin (or any cryptocurrency), you'll need to open an account with a cryptocurrency exchange. Once the account is created, you can transfer money to your crypto account from your bank. After the money is transferred, you can place an order for Bitcoin and other tokens or coins.

Ethereum was up 2.7% to $2,476, Solana rose 4.3% to $162, and Dogecoin—a so-called meme coin that's been touted by Trump ally Elon Musk—jumped 11% to just under 17 cents.\\nBitcoin is on a hot streak this year, having climbed 64%. Last week, it briefly threatened to pass its previous record high when it touched $73,500, before retreating.\\nIts price is likely to swing wildly Tuesday night, when most U.S. markets won't be open. The crypto could jump above $80,000 over the next two months if Trump wins, Bernstein analysts led by Gautam Chhugani said in a research note on Monday. If Harris wins, prices could fall to $50,000, they wrote.\\nEthereum, Solana, and Dogecoin have also risen in the run-up to the election, and could be volatile on Tuesday.\\nBut whoever wins the race to the White House, crypto already looks like it will be one of the election cycle's biggest winners.\\nThe digital-asset industry has got its act together when it comes to lobbying and campaign contributions, with over $130 million spent on congressional and presidential races. The impact is likely to mean, next year's Congress could be one of the most pro-crypto set of lawmakers ever.\\nBoth candidates have also signaled their support for Bitcoin and other tokens. Harris has embraced blockchain as one of the 'industries of the future' that she'll support as part of her economic plan—but it's clear that most crypto bulls are backing Trump.\\nHaving once trashed cryptos as being 'based on thin air,' the Republican nominee has done a dramatic U-turn on this year, pledging in July to set up a Bitcoin strategic reserve and to replace Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler, who's widely seen as a crypto hawk.\\nBut digital-asset companies are feeling optimistic about the future, regardless of whether Harris or Trump wins.\\n'Any outcome that occurs on Tuesday I will still feel very good about where we are,' Faryar Shirzad, chief policy officer at the exchange Coinbase Global, told Barron's last week. 'In a town that's looking for things to do on a bipartisan basis, crypto is a good candidate.'\\nLike tokens, crypto-related stocks were climbing in Tuesday's premarket.

       "   'summary': 'Standard Chartered projects a fourfold increase in the digital assets market cap, reaching $10 trillion by the U.S. mid-term elections in late 2026.\\nWhat Happened: According to a new note from Geoffrey Kendrick, Head of Research at Standard Chartered, this growth forecast is based on anticipated regulatory shifts following a projected Republican sweep in the recent election cycle, which could lead to mainstream adoption and real-world use cases for digital assets.\\nDon\\'t Miss:\\n\\'For me, the Trump-ublican sweep means Digital Assets are finally going to come of age,\\' Kendrick commented, expressing confidence that favorable regulatory policies will drive adoption across the asset class. He added, \"I look for the entire asset class to 4X by the time of the US mid-terms in late 2026.\"\\nStandard Chartered highlight several factors contributing to this growth projection.\\nThese include potential regulatory changes, such as a repeal of SAB 121 and favorable stablecoin regulations, which the bank anticipates could be enacted shortly after the new administration takes office in January 2025.\\nAdditionally, Standard Chartered expects the SEC to adopt a softer regulatory stance on digital assets, further opening pathways for mainstream use.\\nTrending: Over the last five years, the price of gold has increased by approximately 83% — Investors like Bill O\\'Reilly and Rudy Giuliani are using this platform to create customized gold IRAs to help shield their savings from inflation and economic turbulence.\\nThe report also suggests that assets closely linked to practical, end-use cases—like Solana (CRYPTO: SOL), which the bank expects to outperform Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH)—are likely to see the most significant growth.\\nKendrick sees strong growth potential for sectors like gaming, tokenization, and emerging areas such as decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN) and consumer social, which he notes are still in early stages of development.\\nFurthermore, while Standard Chartered considers a U.S. Bitcoin reserve a low-probability event, it notes this move could have a significant impact on the digital assets market if implemented.\\nAlso Read: Dogecoin millionaires are increasing – investors with $1M+ in DOGE revealed!\\nKendrick emphasizes that the regulatory clarity and adoption policies expected from a Trump administration could lift the entire asset class, providing an environment conducive to digital assets going mainstream.\\nStandard Chartered reiterates its end-2025 target prices for Bitcoin at $200,000 and Ethereum at $10,000, driven by expectations of a Republican-led administration\\'s policies.\\nWhat\\'s Next: These insights into the potential trajectory of digital assets and the broader regulatory landscape will be explored further at Benzinga\\'s Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 19, where industry leaders will discuss the future of cryptocurrencies amid anticipated regulatory changes.\\nRead Next:\\nImage: Unsplash\\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS\\' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\\nThis article Bitcoin To $200,000, Ethereum To $10,000 And Crypto Market Cap To 4X By End Of 2025, Says Standard Chartered originally appeared on Benzinga.com',\n",

Crypto narratives could shift dramatically depending on who wins.\\nPotential Narratives if Trump Wins – What's the Best Crypto to Buy Now?\\nPro-crypto former President Donald Trump is broadly seen as more favorable for the crypto market.\\nTrump has openly endorsed Bitcoin and even pledged to establish a national Bitcoin stockpile when he spoke at the Nashville Bitcoin Conference earlier this year.\\nPro-crypto ex-US President Donald Trump is broadly seen as more favorable for the crypto market.\\nTrump has openly endorsed Bitcoin, and pledged to establish a national Bitcoin stockpile when he appeared at the Nashville Bitcoin Conference earlier this year.\\nTesla founder Elon Musk may form a new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under a Trump administration, which could boost interest in Dogecoin (DOGE), a crypto Musk has long supported.\\nAdditionally, if Republicans secure both the House and Senate, we may see increased bets on broad crypto industry regulations in 2025, benefiting various cryptos.\\nIt may also pave the way for additional crypto ETFs, potentially for Solana (SOL) or Ripple (XRP).\\nTrump's pledge to remove SEC chairman Gary Gensler on 'day one' may benefit cryptos currently facing regulatory challenges, particularly those labeled as securities, such as Solana and Cardano (ADA).\\nAdditionally, Trump's involvement in decentralized finance (DeFi) could lead to growth in this space, as he has promoted a Trump family-affiliated project called World Liberty Financial.\\nTrump is embracing #Bitcoin and crypto and says that he wants to leave big banks behind by launching his own crypto token, 'World Liberty Financial'. 👀 pic.twitter.com/2SXQIu9S6K\\n— The ₿itcoin Therapist (@TheBTCTherapist) September 12, 2024\\nThis could provide a strong narrative for DeFi-related tokens like Aave (AAVE), a prominent protocol in the sector.\\nIf major cryptos reach new all-time highs following a Trump victory, there could also be a resurgence in meme and altcoin interest, further driving market enthusiasm.\\nHowever, Trump's policies, including proposals on tariffs and spending, may bring inflationary pressures, potentially reducing the scope for Fed rate cuts, which could dampen market optimism.\\nJessica Tarlov on Fox: We know that Donald Trump's policies will be more inflationary and add like $5.8 trillion to the deficit.

However, any substantial dips might be quickly absorbed by the market.\\nDespite Harris's less aggressive crypto stance, she has indicated an openness to fostering growth in the US crypto industry.\\n🤝 @KamalaHarris pledges to protect crypto investors and support Black male economic empowerment ahead of the election. #USPresidentialElections #CryptoRegulations https://t.co/K7CgIVKJKZ\\n— Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 14, 2024\\nThe macroeconomic backdrop could remain supportive for established cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as the Fed maintains an easing stance, and the economy continues to grow.\\nHarris' policies might contribute to 'goldilocks' economic conditions —stable growth with moderate inflation—potentially benefiting major cryptos in the long term.\\nUnder a Harris administration, debt levels would likely increase, but her stance against new tariffs could help moderate inflation risks.\\nWhile a short-term decline in the crypto market is possible, the long-term outlook remains strong.\\nIf Harris prevails, Bitcoin and Ethereum could stand out as the best cryptos to buy now, as they may benefit from regulatory approval and their reputation as more established assets.\\nWith the election in full swing, the crypto market's trajectory remains tightly intertwined with political dynamics, likely shaping asset performance in response to the chosen administration.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"With the growth of the blockchain market, it is becoming apparent that cryptocurrency might just end up being an everyday necessity soon. The meme coin arena remains as lively as ever. Dogecoin is enjoying a good run at the moment with the coin appearing among the high performers. NEIRO has been experiencing fluctuations over the past couple of months with its limited availability only making it difficult for the holders to take profits.\\nThe newest asset to join in the crypto space is Monsta Mash, a crypto gaming trailblazer with a groundbreaking project that everyone has been on the lookout for. Dogecoin; Bearish Indicators Keep Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Under Pressure\\nDogecoin is currently at a very critical point with the technical indicators at a bearish movement. The DMI and Ichiomoku cloud seem to be pointing at a bearish trend with sellers holding dominance over the trend action. Currently seeking support at the 20-day EMA($0.15) Dogecoin shows a demand at the lower levels.\\nWith the bulls trying to push the price up, Dogecoin is most likely going to surpass the $0.18 resistance level. This RSI level has a likelihood of acting as a barrier but in any case, if the bulls succeed, the Dogecoin could initiate the next phase of moving towards $0.21.\\nAlternatively, by going down instead of breaking the 20-day EMA, it will show that the bulls are losing their hold. Dogecoin could plummet to the 50-day SMA($0.13) which is poised to be a strong support. NEIRO; Is NEIRO Ethereum a scam?\\nHaving been introduced in the meme coin scene recently, its explosion saw it skyrocket quickly to hold the 36th rank in the meme coin arena. NEIRO has however been plagued by rumors that the crypto could be an Ethereum scam.\\nThis proves to be a risky situation for NEIRO which could lead to a downward spiral if any justifiable evidence surfaced. This would have the token holders fleeing. Even if in any case NEIRO managed to dispense itself of the rumors, it's highly unlikely that the NEIRO movement could defy the gravity of a falling crypto market in the long run.\\nWith Bitcoin having had a short-lived plummet below the $50000 level, it is an indication that the crypto market could soon face a near bear. If such an occurrence resurfaces, investors would likely avoid high-risk meme coins like NEIRO causing its inevitable fall. Monsta Mash; Unlocking New Dimensions\\nMonsta Mash has been making waves in the crypto scene thanks to its revolutionary one-of-a-kind new feature that is set to cause an evolution in the crypto gaming arena. This new model utilizes a hybrid Play-to-Earn and Tap-to-Earn approach which means players get paid for just engaging!\\nEven more exciting is that players are allowed to join for free and get rewarded as they play.

       "   'summary': \"Cryptocurrencies are on a rally, with Bitcoin (BTC) hitting an all-time high on Wednesday morning, amid reports of Donald Trump making major gains in the U.S. Presidential election. Bitcoin crossed the $75,000 mark hours after the nation went to polls to elect the 47th president.\\nThe Bitcoin rally has been gaining pace over the past month after the Federal Reserve announced its first interest rate cut in four years. Investors are optimistic about another rate cut at the end of the Federal Reserve's November policy meeting on Thursday, which is likely to give the crypto market a further boost.\\nGiven this situation, investing in Bitcoin related stocks like NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Interactive Brokers Group, Inc.

Ethereum, Cardano and Dogecoin jumped 6.6%, 8.8% and 18.8%, respectively.

Bitcoin ETFs have attracted more than $50 billion in inflows, which has helped create a solid base for Bitcoin's recent price changes.\\nBitcoin is often linked to Trump's campaign because of his strong advocacy for digital assets. He has even pledged to turn the United States into the global hub for cryptocurrency.\\nThe Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis points in September, giving a major boost to cryptocurrencies. Since then, Bitcoin has been on a strong rally. Market participants are now confident that the Federal Reserve will announce another 25 basis-point interest rate cut at the end of its November policy meeting this week, which could further fuel the ongoing rally.\\nAlso, market analysts predict that Bitcoin could exceed $80,000 by the end of November, regardless of the election results.\\nNVIDIA Corporation is a major player in the semiconductor industry and has been one of the standout success stories of 2023.

       "   'summary': \"With the crypto market gearing toward a bull run, investors are seeking altcoins such as Solana and Ripple's XRP, DTX, DOGE, and SHIB. Solana is revered for its high rate in the number of transactions per second and high flexibility among developers while Ripple is still in efforts to pierce past the $1 figure despite legal hurdles.\\nDTX Token Surges 300 Percent in Presale as Investors Eye 50x Gains\\nDTX has seen a 300% profit for early investors since purchasing the token at $0.02, and its price has increased to $0.08 in Stage 4 of its presale. Investors are expected to record a 50% profit once DTX lists on mainstream exchanges at an estimated value of $0.12. For this reason, YouTuber Andrew believes that after its attempts in the mainstream market, DTX will soar past $1.01, and investors will be 50x richer by the end of December 2024.\\nSolana Gains Traction with Fast Transactions and Scalable Blockchain\\nSolana is another altcoin like Ethereum and Cardano the difference is that Solana has better speed and scalability. It supports consumer applications and building decentralized applications or dapps and has high speed and flexibility. Developers can use various programming languages to create on Solana, enhancing accessibility.\\nThe\\nCan XRP Break $1 Barrier with Potential Bitcoin Market Rally?\\nAmong top altcoins, Ripple with its XRP token is the one that is in the top-ten list. Also, it comes with more preference than names like Toncoin, Cardano and Dogecoin on the list of an altcoin. However, the long-drawn legal standoff with the US SEC continues to drag down the price.\\nBowing to bearish pressure, the XRP price nosedived over 4% in the past 7 days, down over 10% on the monthly chart. It trades above $0.52, with top analysts forecasting a potential decline below $0.45 if the $0.5 support fails to hold.\\nHowever, an overall market rally might force an upswing in the Ripple (XRP) price. A new Bitcoin ATH could push it above $1 before the curtain closes on the year. Hence, at its current price, it is a good crypto to buy, with plenty of room to run.\\nDogecoin (DOGE) The OG of Memes\\nDogecoin is the first memecoin. As a result, it is not only one of the best meme currencies to invest in, but also the most popular. Hence, with the bull market on the horizon, Dogecoin is expected to attract a fair share of the new liquidity to enter the market.\\nFurther, as the leading meme-inspired token, it will likely be at the forefront of any meme frenzy. To ride this strong bullish wave, we recommend grabbing a bag of Dogecoin now to position yourself well. This year, DOGE will likely surpass the elusive $1 resistance. With much to look forward to, Dogecoin is one of the best coins to invest in.\\nShiba Inu (SHIB) Price Prediction For 2025\\nShiba Inu (SHIB) is actually shaping up for a great cryptocurrency investment in the time leading to 2025. While top cryptos like the ETFS token target a huge 40,000% rise, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is set to make a decent uptick of about 50x based on present metrics. Since there are no major upcoming developments to suggest a high surge for Shiba Inu (SHIB), experts say its token burn activity and the effect of the bull run will give it a modest increase.\\nConclusion:\\nThe top five cryptocurrencies, Solana, Ripple, DTX, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu, are predicted to have huge price increases and possibly 50x returns by 2025. Solana's high-speed blockchain and Ripple's legal achievements may cause price increases, while DTX Exchange's hybrid trading platform and Dogecoin's meme currency domination are predicted to drive the next rise. Investors are preparing for tremendous growth and significant profits.\\nLearn more:\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Recent updates in the Dogecoin market have triggered caution among investors, with analysts predicting possible downturns contributing to a wavering market sentiment.\\nAt the same time, ongoing legal challenges for Coinbase remain a focal point as the exchange contends with regulatory scrutiny and disputes, including those involving the SEC.\\nWith increasing regulatory oversight, many are exploring alternatives like Plus Wallet, known for its privacy-centric, non-custodial approach to crypto management.\\nAs concerns over control and security grow, the debate intensifies: between Coinbase and Plus Wallet, which provides the solutions modern crypto users need?\\nCoinbase Update: Legal Disputes Underscore Security Risks\\nRecent developments in Coinbase's legal landscape have spotlighted a notable judicial decision amid rising concerns about the scrutiny on crypto exchanges. A judge has mandated the FDIC to disclose 23 'pause letters' from Operation Chokepoint 2.0, which reportedly encouraged banks to limit transactions related to cryptocurrencies.\\nThis legal dispute complements Coinbase's ongoing contention with the SEC regarding the classification of digital assets as securities. These regulatory hurdles have led users to question the security of their assets as exchanges face intricate legal challenges potentially affecting their operational stability and accessibility.\\nDogecoin Market Trends: Rising Pessimism Fuels Instability\\nThe latest insights into the Dogecoin market suggest a cautious stance as analysts foresee potential declines. After a rise in August, DOGE is encountering resistance, dampening the optimistic outlook. Market analyst Alan Santana points to reduced trading volumes and pessimistic trends in significant cryptocurrencies like Solana and Ethereum, which may prompt market corrections.\\nMoreover, the transfer of 1.74 billion DOGE to Robinhood has sparked fears of potential market sell-offs, adding to the prevailing uncertainty. Although November traditionally brings gains, current signs indicate Dogecoin might continue to encounter hurdles.\\nPlus Wallet Provides Unmatched Control & Privacy Amid Regulatory Scrutiny\\nAs regulatory scrutiny heightens in the crypto sector, Plus Wallet provides a crucial option for users desiring sovereign management of their digital assets without the constraints typical of centralized platforms.\\nBy offering a secure, non-custodial wallet, Plus Wallet enables users to fully manage their funds directly, alleviating reliance on exchanges that may be subject to regulatory challenges or constraints. This model offers a dependable choice for maintaining control amid market shifts.\\nPlus Wallet's non-custodial feature is particularly beneficial for handling cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin, ensuring autonomous control even in volatile market conditions. This independence is appealing as regulatory actions increasingly impact exchanges like Coinbase.\\nMoreover, Plus Wallet prioritizes user privacy, eliminating the need for KYC or identity verification, unlike Coinbase. This allows users complete oversight of their assets, aligning with the core principles of decentralized finance (DeFi).\\nIn the current regulatory landscape, Plus Wallet stands out as the premier crypto wallet, providing security, autonomy, and privacy—essential attributes for those who value independence in their financial dealings.\\nKey Insights\\nWith the Dogecoin market signaling caution and Coinbase's legal issues casting a shadow over centralized exchanges, users are increasingly seeking safer avenues for their crypto holdings. In contrast to platforms facing enhanced scrutiny, Plus Wallet offers a robust, user-centric experience through its non-custodial, privacy-focused setup.\\nFreed from the requirements of KYC and identity verification, Plus Wallet embodies the tenets of decentralized finance (DeFi), granting users complete command over their assets without external constraints. For those who prioritize security, privacy, and direct control of assets, Plus Wallet emerges as a solid and trustworthy choice in the face of current regulatory dynamics.\\nExplore Plus Wallet:\",\n",

       "   'summary': '(MENAFN) Bitcoin soared to a new record high in early Wednesday trading as market participants closely tracked the progress of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who pulled ahead of Democratic Contender Kamala Harris. According to CoinMarketCap, a cryptocurrency data platform, Bitcoin surged over 7.8 percent, reaching a peak of USD75,000 per unit. This price surpassed Bitcoin\\'s previous record set in March, during a rally following the launch of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the US stock exchange, which pushed the price to USD73,200.The cryptocurrency market reacted as Trump gained early momentum over Harris, particularly in key swing states like Georgia and North Carolina. As results came in, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, saw its price rise by 6.5 percent, while Dogecoin, also known as Doge and supported by Trump ally Elon Musk, surged by 18 percent. The political landscape has increasingly influenced cryptocurrency movements, with Bitcoin notably associated with Trump due to his pro-digital asset stance.Cryptocurrencies have grown in prominence within political discussions, with many investors now viewing Bitcoin as a \"Trump trade\" amid the Republican candidate\\'s support for digital assets. Trump\\'s endorsement of cryptocurrencies has been clear throughout his campaign, contrasting with other candidates who have shown more caution or regulatory concern towards these assets. His campaign\\'s embrace of crypto has sparked optimism among cryptocurrency supporters who see his leadership as a pathway to favorable policies.If elected, Trump has promised to establish the United States as a global hub for cryptocurrencies. His proposed plans include creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve and appointing regulators inclined to support the growth of digital assets. These commitments, according to Anadolu Agency, highlight Trump\\'s intentions to foster a supportive regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies, further solidifying his standing as a pro-crypto candidate among digital asset investors.\\nMENAFN06112024000045015839ID1108855479\\nMENAFN06112024000045015839ID1108855479',\n",

       "   'summary': \"A new memecoin is turning heads in the crypto world, rapidly gaining traction and challenging well-established tokens. This emerging contender is stirring excitement among investors, hinting at significant shifts in the digital currency landscape. Enthusiasts are watching closely to see how this potential game-changer might reshape the rankings.\\nXYZVerse (XYZ), the first all-sport memecoin, unites fans from football to esports and aims to surpass tokens like PEPE and MOG by achieving exponential growth beyond their impressive gains. The All-Sports Meme Token You Can't Afford to Bench!\\nXYZ is your exclusive VIP pass to a sports-driven, meme-fueled revolution. Think of it as the MVP of the XYZVerse ecosystem, where degens can score big off the growing demand for prediction markets\\nPicture this: Polymarket hitting $1 billion in trading volume during the US presidential election – now throw in the hype of meme coins and the thrill of sports betting. With millions of sports fans ready to hit the field and cash in the XYZVerse ecosystem is set to keep expanding – and your rewards will slam dunk through the roof!\\n>>>XYZ presale is your first-quarter chance to get in before the mind-blowing explosion!<<\\n>Don't be left on the bench – grab your XYZ tokens now and be part of the next massive crypto championship!<< Shiba Inu (SHIB)\\nShiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency that started as a joke but is now turning heads. Inspired by Dogecoin, it sets itself apart by running on the Ethereum blockchain. This means it can work with many other apps and tools in the Ethereum world. Launched in August 2020 by someone named Ryoshi, SHIB began with a whopping one quadrillion tokens. Half of these tokens were given to Vitalik Buterin, one of the creators of Ethereum. He donated a big chunk to help with COVID relief in India and destroyed (or 'burned') 40% of the total tokens, making the remaining SHIB more valuable.\\nUnlike Dogecoin, SHIB's connection to Ethereum allows it to do more than just be a meme. It has its own decentralized exchange called ShibaSwap, where people can trade tokens without a middleman. SHIB also plans to introduce its own platform for digital art (NFTs) and a system where holders can vote on decisions (a DAO). These developments show that SHIB wants to be more useful. In the current market, where people are looking for coins with real-world uses, SHIB's plans could make it more attractive to investors compared to other meme coins. Pepe (PEPE)\\nPEPE is a new memecoin launched on Ethereum as a tribute to the famous Pepe the Frog internet meme created by Matt Furie. Embracing its roots, PEPE keeps things simple and fun, appealing to the crypto community with a no-tax policy and by being upfront about its lack of utility. In late April to May 2023, PEPE experienced an explosive surge, with its market cap reaching a peak of $1.6 billion. Early holders saw astonishing gains, and the coin attracted a strong community of like-minded enthusiasts.\\nThe rise of PEPE has sparked what some call a 'memecoin season,' with other meme-based cryptocurrencies experiencing wild price swings. PEPE's roadmap includes listings on major exchanges and a planned 'meme takeover.' With the upcoming Bitcoin halving and hopes for a new bull run, many are keeping a close eye on PEPE. While it's uncertain how the coin will perform in the long term, its rapid ascent and dedicated following suggest it could continue to make waves in the current market cycle, much like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu did before it. Conclusion\\nWhile SHIB and PEPE have achieved success, XYZVerse (XYZ) seeks to surpass them by uniting sports fans for significant growth in the 2024 bull run.\\nYou can find more information about XYZVersus (XYZ) here:\\nSite , Telegram , X\\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.

       "   'summary': \"Crypto Price Today: The crypto market has witnessed notable shifts following Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election. His win has fueled optimism among investors, driving the market into a bullish phase. Trump's promises to make the U.S. a 'bitcoin and cryptocurrency capital' and his pledge to appoint Elon Musk for a government waste audit have spurred confidence in the future of digital assets under a crypto-friendly administration.\\nBitcoin (BTC) Analysis\\n, the world's first and most valuable cryptocurrency, experienced a 6.6% increase over the past 24 hours, pushing its price to a peak of $76,400 before retracing slightly. Currently, Bitcoin is trading around $74,838.79, down by 0.14% as of the latest data.\\nThe chart shows the price action of Bitcoin (BTC) against Tether (USDT) on Binance over a 30-minute time frame, as of November 7, 2024. Analyzing this chart provides insights into recent price movements, resistance and support levels, and possible future trends.\\nKey Observations\\nPrice Levels and Movement:\\nBitcoin recently hit a peak of around $76,400, marking the highest point on this chart. This level appears to be a significant resistance zone, as prices subsequently fell from this point.\\nFollowing the peak, BTC encountered selling pressure, leading to a dip below $75,000, with a low around $74,611 in the latest sessions.\\nCurrently, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $74,700, showing a slight downward movement as it consolidates around this level.\\nBollinger Bands:\\nThe chart includes Bollinger Bands, which indicate volatility. The bands expanded around the time BTC hit $76,400, suggesting heightened volatility during the rally.\\nAs Bitcoin began to decline, the bands have started to tighten, signaling a potential reduction in volatility and possible consolidation at the current levels.\\nThe midline of the Bollinger Bands, acting as a 20-period moving average, shows that BTC is moving towards this average as it pulls back from the recent high.\\nVolume:\\nVolume activity increased significantly during the surge towards $76,400, indicating strong buying momentum at that time.\\nThe volume has now tapered, which often signals that the immediate buying momentum may be slowing, and a potential period of consolidation could follow.\\nSupport and Resistance Levels:\\nThe peak around $76,400 serves as the most immediate resistance level. BTC would need to break and sustain above this level to continue its upward trajectory.\\nOn the downside, $74,000 appears to be a nearby support level. If BTC falls below this point, the next support could be around $73,500 to $73,000, based on recent lows shown in the chart.\\nMarket Trend:\\nThe general uptrend that led to the recent high reflects a bullish sentiment. However, the slight pullback after the peak indicates potential profit-taking by short-term traders.\\nA consolidation phase is likely as BTC stabilizes after a strong rally, especially around the $74,500-$75,000 range, unless a major catalyst drives new momentum.\\nEthereum (ETH) Performance\\nThe Ethereum chart shows strong upward momentum, with ETH nearing the upper limit of its Bollinger Bands, signaling overbought conditions. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also approaching the overbought zone, standing at 69.89. This could indicate a potential correction if buyers take profits at these levels. However, with Ethereum 2.0 upgrades on the horizon, demand for ETH continues to rise, driven by its applications in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\\nSolana (SOL) Gains\\nSolana (SOL) is another asset benefiting from the positive market sentiment. Currently trading at $188.73, Solana has gained 1.97% in the last 24 hours and 7.78% over the past week. Known for its fast transaction speeds and low fees,\\nRipple (XRP) Growth\\nDogecoin (DOGE) Decline\\nDogecoin (DOGE), often popularized by endorsements from\\nPolkadot (DOT) Resilience\\nPolkadot (DOT) displayed resilience, posting a 1.90% gain to reach $4.14. Despite a 0.58% decline over the past week, DOT continues to attract attention as a versatile platform for cross-chain compatibility. With increased focus on interoperability, Polkadot's innovations keep it relevant in a competitive market. DOT's steady performance aligns with investor interest in platforms facilitating blockchain communication.\\nShiba Inu (SHIB) Volatility\\nShiba Inu (SHIB), another popular\\nOther Notable Performers\\nSeveral other cryptos recorded impressive gains in the past 24 hours:\\nLido DAO (LDO) led the gains with a 30.98% increase, reaching $1.39.\\nNEIRO surged 25.75% to $0.001979, supported by positive sentiment in the market.\\nRaydium (RAY) climbed 24.60% to $4.56, reflecting increased DeFi interest on the Solana blockchain.\\nAave (AAVE) also saw a strong boost, rising 22.63% to $182.85 as it benefits from increased DeFi activity.\\nThese altcoins reflect broader market enthusiasm and investor focus on decentralized finance platforms, especially with regulatory clarity on the horizon.\\nMarket Sentiment and Index\\nThe Market Fear & Greed Index, a popular indicator of investor sentiment, currently stands at 62 (Neutral). This score suggests balanced sentiment in the market, as investors weigh optimism surrounding Trump's pro-crypto stance against the risks of a potential market correction after recent rallies.\\nOverall Market Cap and Volume\\nThe global crypto market cap now stands at $2.54 trillion, marking a 3.58% increase over the past 24 hours. Increased trading volume across top assets highlights rising investor interest in digital currencies, driven by expectations of favorable U.S. policies under Trump's administration.\\nTrump's Impact on the Crypto Market\\nTrump's re-election has brought a new wave of optimism to the crypto sector. His plans to make the U.S. the 'crypto capital of the world' and appoint Elon Musk for a comprehensive government audit have created a sense of confidence in future regulations. Investors anticipate that a crypto-friendly government could ease regulatory pressures, further driving adoption and institutional interest.\\nFuture Outlook\\nWith Bitcoin near record highs and altcoins like Ethereum and Ripple gaining momentum, the market appears bullish. Investors should monitor key resistance levels for Bitcoin, which could signal further gains if breached. The upcoming weeks could see increased market activity as more investors join the rally.\\nHowever, profit-taking may lead to short-term corrections, especially in meme-based assets like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Major assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum could stabilize near current levels or continue their upward momentum, depending on market sentiment and regulatory developments.\\nAs Trump's administration unfolds, the crypto market's trajectory will likely be influenced by policy decisions. For now, optimism prevails, and the market looks set for a potential period of growth driven by increasing institutional and retail participation.\\nToday's crypto market reflects a mix of optimism and caution. Bitcoin holds near its recent high, while Ethereum, Ripple, and Solana show strong growth. Trump's victory has spurred hope for a crypto-friendly era, with investors betting on supportive regulations.\\nThe top gainers, like Lido DAO, NEIRO, and Aave, highlight a renewed interest in DeFi and decentralized solutions. Conversely, meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu remain volatile, underscoring the speculative nature of such assets.\\nWith the global market cap at $2.54 trillion and trading volumes on the rise, the crypto market's future looks promising. Investors will keep a close eye on Trump's policies and potential regulatory shifts, as these will shape the market's next moves.\",\n",

The debut of US-listed Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January had a huge impact on the market and by March, Bitcoin\\'s value had surged to more than $70,000. Now, Bitcoin has reached an all-time high of more than $75,000 in what could be the start of a record run for the popular cryptocurrency following the US presidential election.\\nValue has fluctuated between $55,000 and $70,000 over the past several months, but Donald Trump\\'s victory in the US presidential election has shaken up the market.\\nAJ Bell analyst Russ Mould told The Guardian just ahead of the election on Tuesday that many investors believed that a Republican win would result in a surge for the cryptocurrency. Nigel Green from financial advisory group deVere said a Trump win could be the catalyst that pushes the digital currency into uncharted territory.\\nAs the publication highlights, Trump initially viewed cryptocurrencies as a scam but later changed his stance. Green added that Trump\\'s return to the White House could result in a renewed emphasis on deregulation, tax breaks, and other policies that could favor alternative investments like Bitcoin.\\nOther cryptocurrencies are also riding the political wave. Ethereum is up eight percent over the last 24 hours, Solana has increased more than 10 percent in the same period, and Dogecoin is up 9.19 percent.\\nDuring his campaign, Trump promised to make America the crypto capital of the world. A report from the Associated Press noted plans to create a \"strategic reserve\" of Bitcoin if elected. He also spoke at a cryptocurrency conference over the summer, and even accepted cryptocurrency donations during his campaign.\\nBitcoin was also in the news recently after an HBO documentary named Canadian developer Peter Todd as the mysterious creator of the cryptocurrency. Todd denied the claims and ultimately went into hiding.\\nImage credit: Getty Images, Choong Deng Xiang',\n",

Despite these individual gains, the global cryptocurrency market cap declined by 1.68% over the past 24 hours to roughly $2.25 trillion.\"Bitcoin is facing resistance at $69,000 after last week\\'s gains. We expect high volatility this week, driven by the US presidential election and the Fed\\'s policy meeting,\" said Vikram Subburaj, CEO of Giottus Crypto Platform. \"A rally above $72,000 could be likely if Trump secures a victory, while support remains strong at $66,000 if a drop occurs.\"Edul Patel, CEO of Mudrex, said, \"With just one day remaining before the U.S. presidential election, the crypto market is closely watching for the outcome. Bitcoin, currently trading at $69,000, has declined by over 4% over the weekend as investors adopt a cautious approach. Although technical charts suggest momentum is building, investors\\' reaction to the election outcome is expected to be the key driver of BTC\\'s price action.

Bitcoin\\'s dominance is currently 60.63%, according to CoinMarketCap. BTC volume in the last 24 hours surged 42.64% to $33.44 billion.Earlier this week, Bitcoin\\'s pullback near its all-time high may have prompted short-term traders to lock in profits. Despite the price retreating to around $68,000, analysts remain optimistic, expecting Bitcoin to find solid support within the $65,000 to $68,000 range. The upcoming U.S. elections are the next significant catalyst for the crypto markets. A break above $70,000 in the near term could lift investor sentiment, driving renewed buying interest in select altcoins as well.BTC after making the all-time high of $73,777 was trading in the \\'Descending Channel\\' pattern. The asset gave a breakout above the channel and rallied up to $73,620. However, the bulls failed to cross the previous all-time and the prices witnessed some profit booking. BTC has struggled to give a weekly closing above the $70k mark in the past and this time also it failed to do that. Once it gives a weekly close above $70,000 and sustains above the previous all-time high then we may expect it to rally further.Support 1: $66,500Support 2: $62,000Resistance 1: $70,000Resistance 2: $73,777',\n",

The Mexican peso was down nearly 2.8% on Tuesday evening, and, inversely, the dollar was up 1.35%.\",\n",

       "   'summary': 'The cryptocurrency market showed mixed trends on Monday as investors prepared for key events—the US presidential election and an anticipated Federal Reserve rate cut, both of which could significantly impact crypto markets.\\nADVERTISEMENT Major tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Tron, and Toncoin saw gains, while others such as BNB, Cardano, Shiba Inu, Chainlink, Polkadot, Litecoin, Uniswap, and NEAR Protocol experienced losses of up to 3%.\\nAt 12:02 pm IST, Bitcoin (BTC) traded 0.84% higher at $69,014, while Ethereum rose by 0.9% to $2,472. Despite these individual gains, the global cryptocurrency market cap declined by 1.68% over the past 24 hours to roughly $2.25 trillion.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\"Bitcoin is facing resistance at $69,000 after last week\\'s gains. We expect high volatility this week, driven by the US presidential election and the Fed\\'s policy meeting,\" said Vikram Subburaj, CEO of Giottus Crypto Platform. \"A rally above $72,000 could be likely if Trump secures a victory, while support remains strong at $66,000 if a drop occurs.\"Edul Patel, CEO of Mudrex, said, \"With just one day remaining before the U.S. presidential election, the crypto market is closely watching for the outcome. Bitcoin, currently trading at $69,000, has declined by over 4% over the weekend as investors adopt a cautious approach. Although technical charts suggest momentum is building, investors\\' reaction to the election outcome is expected to be the key driver of BTC\\'s price action. Bitcoin faces resistance at $70,900, with support at the $67,400 level.\"The volume of all stablecoins is now $65.12 billion, which is 93.44% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume, as per data available on CoinMarketCap.\\nADVERTISEMENT In the last 24 hours, the market cap of Bitcoin, the world\\'s largest cryptocurrency, increased to $1.363 trillion. Bitcoin\\'s dominance is currently 60.63%, according to CoinMarketCap. BTC volume in the last 24 hours surged 42.64% to $33.44 billion.\\nADVERTISEMENT Earlier this week, Bitcoin\\'s pullback near its all-time high may have prompted short-term traders to lock in profits. Despite the price retreating to around $68,000, analysts remain optimistic, expecting Bitcoin to find solid support within the $65,000 to $68,000 range. The upcoming U.S. elections are the next significant catalyst for the crypto markets. A break above $70,000 in the near term could lift investor sentiment, driving renewed buying interest in select altcoins as well.\\nBTC after making the all-time high of $73,777 was trading in the \\'Descending Channel\\' pattern. The asset gave a breakout above the channel and rallied up to $73,620. However, the bulls failed to cross the previous all-time and the prices witnessed some profit booking. BTC has struggled to give a weekly closing above the $70k mark in the past and this time also it failed to do that. Once it gives a weekly close above $70,000 and sustains above the previous all-time high then we may expect it to rally further.\\nKey Levels for BTC:\\nADVERTISEMENT Support 1: $66,500Support 2: $62,000Resistance 1: $70,000Resistance 2: $73,777\\n(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views, and opinions given by the experts are their own.

       "   'summary': \"After Donald Trump was re-elected in the 2024 elections, the cryptocurrency market gained new momentum, with Bitcoin nearing an all-time high of $75,000. His open endorsement of digital assets, reinforced by expected regulatory reforms, has spurred fervent market interest, particularly in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency-related stocks. Major market players and altcoins like Ethereum and Dogecoin are also experiencing this pro-crypto shift within the crypto industry.\\nTrump's Pro-Bitcoin Agenda Boosts Market Confidence\\nTrump's victory in the elections and his attitude toward cryptocurrencies have catalyzed the growth of optimistic forecasts for shareholders since he hints at policies that could benefit Bitcoin and other digital assets. Trump mentioned the possibility of creating a federal Bitcoin standard and has shown the desire to lessen the regulatory burden in the cryptocurrency industry. Analysts within the industry believe that he is likely to alter the country's tax policies, and there could be changes made by the leaders of the SEC to bring in more compliant burdens.\\nThis impact has been seen throughout the cryptocurrency industry as prominent companies such as Coinbase and MicroStrategy experienced stock increases due to Trump's position. Coinbase's CEO congratulated Trump on his win and called it a victory for the cryptocurrency community to rally behind and increase investment in cryptocurrencies. Advancements in Bitcoin suggest it could potentially reach $100,000, particularly if favourable changes by authorities are made for other assets.\\nBitcoin ETFs Increases with Record Trading Volume\\nOn Election Day, BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), registered the highest trading volume since its launch, exceeding $4.1 billion. Volumes have progressively spiked, representing growing interest in Bitcoin ETFs due to anticipated positive changes in regulation when Trump is in power. The trading volume in the exchange-traded funds managed by BlackRock was also higher than that of several large-cap stocks, which Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas pointed out.\\nAnalysts believe long-term buying pressure from ETFs will further push demand and ultimately propel Bitcoin's prices to even greater heights. The trend also refers to a gradual integration of digital assets into the global financial markets, where an increasing number of asset managers are applying for ETFs that cover various\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Dogecoin's intraday performance today highlights just how explosive meme coin rallies can be.\\nThe original and biggest meme coin, Dogecoin ($DOGE), is positively soaring today along with most leading cryptocurrencies after the pro-crypto Donald Trump was re-elected as the forty-seventh US President.\\nIn the last twenty-four hours, Dogecoin mushroomed 18% to trade at $0.2014. Considering Dogecoin grew 18.7% in the last seven days, this suggests Trump's re-election accounts for the vast majority of Dogecoin's intraweek gains.\\nThis is not surprising. One of Trump's most ardent advocates is Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who formerly used to shill Dogecoin regularly in market-moving tweets until people started debating whether his actions constitute price manipulation.\\nMeanwhile, the original and largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin ($BTC), hit a new all-time high of $75,358.70 in the early hours, UTC.\\nBitcoin advanced 8% overnight, but only 2.9% over the week. Today's gains mean that the $1.5 trillion market cap coin is 110% more valuable than it was this time last year.\\nHowever, since Dogecoin grew 177% over the year, it is arguably the better performing asset.\\nDogecoin Price Analysis: Is $10 DOGE Next?\\nDogecoin's intraday performance today highlights just how explosive meme coin rallies can be. Other leading meme coins that posted similar overnight gains include Pepe ($PEPE) and DogWifHat ($WIF), both up 15%, Bonk ($BONK) is up 18% and Popcat ($POPCAT) ballooned 19%.\\nThe coin's loyal community, the self-styled 'Doge army', have long eyed the $1 mark as their most significant milestone.\\nThe closest Dogecoin came was $0.73, way back in May 1, 2021. Today's price reflects a 73% retreat since.\\nSo, clearly $1 is an important precursor to $10 Dogecoin. But will it get there? Well, today's news is not enough to sustain investment in Dogecoin.\\nIf Trump quickly delivers on his promise to bring regulatory clarity to crypto businesses, this could help drive crypto prices across the market.\\nGiven Dogecoin's status as a crypto profit/loss multiplier, if the market does well in the coming months, Dogecoin will also likely be doing very well.\\nThat said, Dogecoin's relative strength index is 75, which means it is overbought/overvalued right now, so traders will be doing some selling and profit-taking overnight, which will reduce the momentum of this rally, but the Doge Army will be looking for more festive gains.\\nAs Dogecoin Mounts a Speedy Recovery, Flockerz Bird Meme Coin Raises $1.3 Million\\nDogecoin may be everyone's favourite meme coin but with a towering $29 billion market cap, it can only move so far.\\nMeme coin investors looking for greater upside potential should consider diversifying their portfolios with presale allocations. Investing in the right new cryptocurrencies before they hit the open market can often result in 10x or 100x profits.\\nThis month, meme coin fans have been piling into a new vote-to-earn (V2E) meme coin called Flockerz ($FLOCK), a month-old presale that has raised $1.3 million dollars.\\nTouting itself as 'The People's Meme Coin,' Flockerz offers crypto fans unrivaled community-building incentives and staking rewards.\\nIt's also on Ethereum, which uses 99% less electricity than the consumptive Dogecoin.\\nHolders of Flockerz (known as 'The $FLOCK') are members of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called Flocktopia, where they can draft and vote on governance and improvement proposals.\\nThis structure ensures community consensus dictates the decisions rather than a centralized authority.\\nSome 25% of the project's 12 billion $FLOCK meme coin supply is for staking, with the protocol offering stakes yield of 1,312% on the tokens they stake over a two-year period.\\nFlockerz is a transparent and fully audited project.\\nThat's why Coinsult audited its smart contract, to give investors peace of mind.\\nFurthermore, Flockerz is eyeing up listings on both centralized and decentralized exchanges (CEXs and DEXs), so it has global ambitions.\\nJoin now.

Bitcoin Has Set A New Record Above $75,000 Today\\nThe moment Bitcoin investors have been waiting for these past few months has finally happened, as the number one cryptocurrency has set a brand new price record beyond the $75,000 mark during the past day.\\nThe below chart shows how the asset's recent trajectory has looked:\\nThe price of the coin appears to have shot up over the last 24 hours | Source: BTCUSDT on TradingView\\nThis latest bullish burst in the coin came as investors were betting big on a win for pro-crypto Donald Trump in the US presidential elections. The results have settled now, and Trump has indeed returned to the White House for his second term.\\nBTC hasn't been the only asset that has enjoyed this positive wave, of course, as the altcoins have also displayed rallies of their own. A lot of the alts have, in fact, put together better gains than the 8% jump that Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen in the last 24 hours.\\nGiven all that has been happening in the sector, it's not a surprise to see that the derivatives side has also been quite lively. Crypto Derivatives Market Has Just Seen $574 Million In Liquidations\\nAccording to data from CoinGlass, a mass liquidation event has occurred in the sector during the past day. The 'liquidation' of any open contract occurs when its platform forcibly shuts it down after it amasses losses of a certain degree (the exact value of which can differ between exchanges).\\nIn total, $574 million worth of cryptocurrency positions have undergone this process in the last 24 hours.\\nLooks like the liquidations from this window have been lopsided towards the shorts | Source: CoinGlass\\nOut of these, almost $385 million of the liquidations have involved short contracts. This represents 67% of the total, which, while still an obvious majority, isn't quite as lopsided as during similar bullish events in the past.\\nMore than $189 million in longs still managing to get liquidated through the positive price action suggests that a lot of these positions were opened at the Bitcoin top.\\nIn terms of the contribution from the individual symbols, Bitcoin has unsurprisingly occupied the largest share with nearly $275 million in liquidations.\\nThe breakdown of the latest liquidations by symbol | Source: CoinGlass\\nWhat is a surprise, however, is Dogecoin (DOGE) coming in second ahead of Ethereum, despite the large difference between the market caps of the two. This means that the memecoin has been garnering a huge amount of speculative interest recently.\\nThese coins have only witnessed $57 million and $49 million in liquidations, respectively, though, which isn't much when compared to Bitcoin's total. Thus, the original digital asset has very much been the main focus of the market.\\n$574 million in contracts have been flushed so far, but it appears this hasn't been enough to dissuade the speculators, as the BTC Open Interest has only surged to a new all-time high (ATH).\\nThe trend in the Bitcoin Open Interest over the last few months | Source: CoinGlass\\nFeatured image from Dall-E, CoinGlass.com, chart from TradingView.com\",\n",

The market seems to have reacted in advance to Trump\\'s earlier hints about potentially designating BTC as a strategic reserve asset,\" said Ryan Lee, chief analyst, Bitget Research. Lee feels that while both a Trump or Harris victory could signal substantial growth potential for US stocks, the effects on the crypto market could vary.\\nSumit Gupta of CoinDCX notes that since its inception Bitcoin has witnessed three election cycles and rallied to a new record, with prices never returning to pre-election levels.\\nShivam Thakral of BuyUcoin notes that apart from the positive impact on the broader cryptocurrency market, other digital assets like Ether and Dogecoin are also experiencing notable gains.

       "   'summary': \"Cryptocurrency markets are particularly volatile on U.S. election day, with political-themed meme coins and prediction markets seeing significant volumes. To date, the decentralized prediction market Polymarket has seen over $3 billion in election-related trading volume as voters decide between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.\\nTrump-themed tokens have seen major gains. MAGA, the largest politically-themed token with a $196 million market cap, gained 33% over the past 24 hours after Trump's odds of winning increased. Department Of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a meme coin inspired by Elon Musk's support for Trump, rallied significantly by 91% over the past 24 hours, pushing its market cap above $77 million.\\nOn the Democratic side, Kamala Horris (KAMA) dropped by a staggering 86% over the past 24 hours as Kamala Harris's odds of winning dropped. Interestingly enough, a previously popular Jeo Boden (BODEN) token gained 11% despite President Biden withdrawing from the race.\\nBut that's not all for the impacts of the election on cryptocurrency markets: traders say Bitcoin's price may jump as high as 3.5% on election night. In the lead-up, trading platforms are recording activity not seen in years, with over 40 new tokens related to Trump launching on Ethereum and more than 1,000 going live on Solana in under 24 hours.\\nAmong major cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin leads the gains with a 31% jump to $0.21, followed by Bitcoin's 8% gain to new all-time highs.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"The latest Dogecoin market update has sparked caution among analysts, with forecasts of potential declines adding to an uncertain outlook.\\nMeanwhile, Coinbase news continues to capture attention as the exchange grapples with ongoing legal battles, including regulatory scrutiny and disputes with the SEC.\\nAs regulatory scrutiny intensifies, many are considering alternatives like Plus Wallet, which offers a privacy-focused, non-custodial model for crypto management.\\nWith control and security increasingly in focus, the question arises: which platform ultimately meets the needs of today's crypto user — Coinbase or Plus Wallet? Coinbase News: Legal Battle Highlights Security Concerns\\nCoinbase news recently highlighted a significant court win that underscores a growing concern: the increasing scrutiny over crypto exchanges. A judge has ordered the FDIC to release 23 'pause letters' tied to Operation Chokepoint 2.0, which allegedly pressured banks to restrict crypto-related deposits.\\nThis legal battle adds to the tension as Coinbase faces a separate dispute with the SEC over securities regulations for digital assets. These ongoing regulatory challenges have left many users questioning the security of their funds, as crypto exchanges navigate complex legal pressures that could impact service accessibility and stability. Dogecoin Market Update: Bearish Indicators Raise Uncertainty\\nThe latest Dogecoin market update shows a cautious outlook as analysts predict potential declines ahead. Following a recent surge in August, DOGE faces resistance levels that have tempered bullish sentiment. Analyst Alan Santana highlights low trading volume and bearish trends in major cryptocurrencies like Solana and Ethereum, which could lead to market corrections.\\nAdditionally, a large transfer of 1.74 billion DOGE to Robinhood has raised concerns about possible sell-offs, amplifying uncertainty in the market. While November has historically seen gains, current indicators suggest Dogecoin might continue to face challenges. Plus Wallet Delivers Unmatched Control & Privacy Amid Crypto Regulation\\nWith regulatory scrutiny increasing across the crypto industry, Plus Wallet offers a timely solution for those who seek control over their digital assets without the limitations often imposed on centralised platforms.\\nAs a secure, non-custodial wallet, Plus Wallet empowers users with full ownership of their funds, allowing direct management without dependency on exchanges that may face regulatory pressures or restrictions. This approach gives users a reliable alternative to maintain control in a shifting market environment.\\nPlus Wallet's non-custodial design is especially valuable for managing assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and more, enabling independent asset control even during times of market volatility. This independence is an attractive option amid heightened scrutiny on exchanges, including the recent regulatory actions affecting platforms like Coinbase.\\nIn addition to control, Plus Wallet values user privacy, which means it requires no KYC or identity verification, unlike Coinbase. Users maintain full control over their assets with no personal information required, reflecting the principles of decentralised finance (DeFi) in its purest form.\\nIn today's regulatory environment, Plus Wallet proves to be the best wallet for crypto, offering security, autonomy, and privacy—key qualities for those who prioritise independence in their financial activities. The Bottom Line\\nWith the Dogecoin market update signaling caution and Coinbase news spotlighting the regulatory challenges facing centralised exchanges, users may find themselves seeking more secure options for managing their crypto assets. In contrast to platforms under increased scrutiny, Plus Wallet provides a dependable, user-controlled experience through its non-custodial, privacy-oriented design.\\nFree from KYC and identity verification requirements, Plus Wallet upholds the values of decentralised finance (DeFi), giving users full control over their assets without external limitations. For those prioritising security, privacy, and direct asset control, Plus Wallet presents a strong, reliable choice amid today's regulatory pressures.\\nExplore Plus Wallet:\\nWebsite: https://pluswallet.app/\\nDownload: https://onelink.to/pluswalletapp\\nTwitter: https://x.com/pluswalletapp\\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/pluswallet.app/\\nDisclaimer: This is a paid release.

Ethereum climbed 8.6% to $2,621, Solana spiked 14% to $188, and Dogecoin—a so-called meme token that's been touted by Trump ally Elon Musk—surged 24% to just under 21 cents.\\nThe surge in prices is a clear sign that the market believes Trump is set to win the election. Late Tuesday, the Associated Press projected that the Republican candidate would win North Carolina's 16 electoral college votes. Early Wednesday, it called Georgia and its 19 electoral votes and Pennsylvania and its 19 electoral votes for Trump.\\nBoth candidates have embraced crypto this election cycle. Harris called blockchain one of the 'industries of the future,' and pledged to support Bitcoin and other tokens as part of her economic plan.\\nBut it's been obvious for a while that most digital-asset bulls were rooting for Trump. Having once trashed cryptos as being 'based on thin air,' the Republican nominee has done a dramatic U-turn on the sector this year. In July, he pledged to set up a Bitcoin strategic reserve and to replace Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler, who's widely seen as a crypto hawk.\\nThe price of Bitcoin had been expected to swing wildly late Tuesday and early Wednesday, when most other U.S. markets weren't open. The crypto could jump above $80,000 over the next two months if Trump wins, Bernstein analysts led by Gautam Chhugani said in a research note on Monday. If Harris wins, prices could fall to $50,000, they wrote.\\nWrite to Joe Light at joe.light@barrons.com and George Glover at george.glover@dowjones.com\",\n",

Republicans regained control of the Senate in powerful fashion, after former head of the Senate Banking Committee Sherrod Brown was ousted from the seat he has held since 2007 by challenger Bernie Moreno.\\nWhile results of House races were too close to call for control, odds of a Republican sweep surged to hit 97% on betting site Polymarket as of Wednesday morning. Since polls first closed Tuesday night, Bitcoin had surged 7%.\\nOther cryptocurrencies also surged, with Ethereum rising 8% and Elon Musk\\'s favored Dogecoin rising another 17%.\\nTo be sure, many margins in plenty of races were still close enough to need more time to call.\\nAnalysts had predicted ahead of the election that a Republican sweep would be the most bullish scenario for crypto and Bitcoin\\'s price. Almost all of the key races watched by crypto advocates went to Republicans, with the exception of Senator Elizabeth Warren\\'s race against pro-crypto challenger John Deaton.\\nFundstrat\\'s Head of Digital Asset Strategy Sean Farrell, who had previously predicted Bitcoin will cross $115,000 by the end of the year had said the reaction would be fast as results trickled in.\\n\"We likely see a lot of volatility as leverage pours into the market, but the direction is clear, and the trajectory will be sharp,\" he wrote in a new research note. \"We think it is right to expect a violent binary reaction to the election results (Trump higher, Harris lower), but eventually, we will resume trading in concert with changes in the macro backdrop.\"\\nAs the election is settled, investors will have to immediately grapple with a Fed decision on Wednesday.

       "   'summary': \"The crypto market has seen significant inflows over the past 30 days, a trend that has intensified notably in the last two weeks. Interestingly, most of the inflow has been into Bitcoin , which has caused the leading cryptocurrency to break into new all-time highs back to back .\\nEthereum, although late to the party, has started to receive huge inflows in the past 48 hours. As such, the leading altcoin has surged by about 24% in the past seven days. This has allowed it to break above $3,000 for the first time since early August. This impressive Ethereum price rally is casting a spotlight on the rest of the altcoin market, especially the notion of an altcoin season. Altcoin Market Cap On The Verge Of A Breakout\\nThe combined market cap of altcoins, representing all cryptocurrencies excluding Bitcoin, has increased massively since the beginning of November. According to a TradingView chart initially shared on social media platform X by crypto analyst Captain Faibik, the altcoin market has been on an uptrend from a November low of $860 billion on November 4. At the time of writing, this market cap stands at $1.095 trillion, which represents a 27.3% altcoin market increase in less than a week.\\nTotal crypto market cap at $2.66 trillion on the daily chart: TradingView.com\\nThis uptrend, which has stemmed from a wider inflow into the crypto market, has seen the altcoin market cap now breaking out of a descending trendline when plotted from its March 13 high of $1.267 trillion. With this in mind, crypto analyst Captain Faibik noted that the 'altcoins party hasn't started yet,' hinting at the possibility of an altcoin season rolling in very soon.\\nInterestingly, the analyst foresees a further $349 billion inflow into the altcoin market before the end of the year, which would cause a further 31.41% increase from the descending trendline. Should this prediction materialize, it will see the altcoin market cap breaking into a new 2024 high.\\nImage from X : Captain Faibik Altcoin Season Closer Than Before\\nCoinMarketCap data shows that the Altcoin Season Index currently stands at 38 out of 100, still a notable distance from the 75 threshold needed to declare an official altcoin season. However, recent trends and momentum within the altcoin market hint that the onset of an altcoin season may be closer than previously expected since the beginning of the year. An altcoin season is defined by a period when altcoins start to overperform Bitcoin in gains as investors start to diversify their portfolios.\\nAt the time of writing, the majority of large market-cap altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin in both the 24-hour and seven-day timeframes. Ethereum, Solana, Dogecoin, and Cardano are currently up by 30%, 25%, 70%, and 52%, respectively, in the past seven days, compared to Bitcoin's 16% increase in the same timeframe.\\nFeatured image from TheStreet, chart from TradingView\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"The crypto market came to life late on Tuesday as it became clear President Trump would win the election. It was likely that either candidate would have been good for the crypto industry, which has led to a rise in crypto values this year, but this may have been a best-case scenario for policy changes.\\n(\\n0.73%\\n)\\nwas the biggest winner from a valuation perspective, climbing 11.3% in the past week as of 3 p.m. ET to a $1.52 trillion market cap. But\\nEthereum\\n(\\n1.83%\\n)\\nwas up 18%, and\\nDogecoin\\n(\\n2.07%\\n)\\njumped 22.6% in that time, according to data provided by\\nThe election and policy changes ahead\\nThe last four years have been frustrating for cryptocurrency enthusiasts and developers because the regulatory environment has been uncertain, at best. Instead of outlining clear rules, both Congress and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have left rules in a gray area and only enforced with legal charges once companies release products.\\nThat's the lack of clarity companies have been talking about, and it's possible that changes. On the SEC level, Chair Gary Gensler will likely be replaced quickly after Trump takes office, and that will change the enforcement environment almost immediately. Rule changes will take time, but that will also follow.\\nIt also looks like Republicans will control both houses of Congress, which means both political appointments and laws can be passed that may favor the industry. We don't know what that looks like yet, but innovation won't happen without some kind of clarity.\\nInvestors bet big on crypto\\nThe SEC did allow Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs earlier this year, and in less than 36 hours, the Bitcoin ETFs alone saw $1.3 billion of inflows after the election. Those inflows were part of the price increase through simple supply and demand.\\nWe may see even more ETFs if the regulatory environment changes, which could bring even more inflows.\\nElon Musk and the Dogecoin pop\\nWhen it comes to Dogecoin, there's speculation that Elon Musk's involvement in the campaign could lead to some kind of value for the token. That's a long shot, but it's the kind of speculation that's commonplace in the market today.\\nThis was the biggest meme coin to pop, but it wasn't the only one, with many smaller tokens rising double digits this week.\\nWhere does crypto go from here?\\nWhile the increase in values makes some sense if there are regulatory changes, it doesn't mean the increase will last. A lot of the advances in crypto over the past two years weren't with tokens -- it was with the underlying blockchain and stablecoins used for transactions. Even native tokens may not generate value if stablecoins are what we use for transactions.\\nI think there's a bright future for the blockchain, but the companies building blockchain technology will be the beneficiaries. Speculating on tokens probably won't last, just as we saw in 2022, when a frothy market ended badly for crypto investors.\",\n",

Now it's Ethereum's turn, and with it, Uniswap.\\nThe victory of 'crypto president' Donald Trump continues to reverberate through the market, with Uniswap's native $UNI token rallying to hit a four-month high of $9.34 in the early hours UTC.\\nHowever, Uniswap is now trading five cents below $9. The sharp retreat means that the token powering the eponymous decentralized exchange is actually trading 2.3% below its price this time yesterday, but still 13.8% more valuable than it was seven days ago.\\nThe broader crypto market grew by 0.9% in the last 24 hours and now commands a towering market capitalization of $2.64 trillion.\\nThe original and biggest cryptocurrency, the $1.5 trillion Bitcoin ($BTC), rallied to an all-time high ($ATH) of $76,243.98 yesterday. It has since retreated 1.8% down to $74,884, which signals a light 24-hour pullback of 0.7%.\\nToday, it's the turn of Uniswap's host Ethereum ($ETH) to lead the gains. Ethereum performed much better than Bitcoin last night and advanced 7.4% in 24 hours to trade at $2,822.35 as of this writing.\\nUniswap Analysis: Can $UNI Break Through to $100?\\nThe closest Uniswap's $UNI token has ever come to $100 was $44.92 on May 3rd, 2021. Since then it has retreated by 80%.\\nWhile the token's Trump induced rally was evidently very sharp, support for the token has been growing over the last three months and $UNI has been finding new resistance levels, as shown by the respective red (support) and green (resistance) lines below.\\nThat said, Uniswap's rally today is likely to be because of the increased investor interest in Ethereum over the last 24 hours. Still, $UNI is likely to hold on to all of its gains as its relative strength index (RSI) currently sits at 54, which means it is priced well right now.\\nBut can it hit $100? Maybe in 2025!\\nBeyond Uniswap, Trump Win Boosts Crypto All-Stars $3 Million Presale\\nBeing a $5 billion DEX token on Uniswap means that Uniswap is the closest thing to a 'safe' investment in the volatile world of DeFi, but that safety comes at a price.\\nUniswap lacks the headroom for growth that is found among crypto projects in the presale market, where various meme coin and protocol token launches are easily and quickly bagging 10x or even 100x profits for investors.\\nOne new protocol called Crypto All-Stars hopes to change the negative perceptions around meme coins by letting crypto fans put them to work.\\nCrypto All-Stars is a unified staking protocol that allows users to earn serious rewards by combining the world's most celebrated meme coins.\\nUsers can stake Pepe Coin, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Floki Inu, Based Brett, MogCoin, Milady, TurboToken, Toshi The Cat, Coq Inu, and BonkCoin in the MemeVault to earn passive income.\\nThe current reward rate for staking these coins is an impressive 501% in the form of $STARS.\\nThe project has gained so much popularity that its presale has already raised over $3.1 million, while Uniswap.\\nFollowing the purchase, investors can begin staking for rewards and claim the tokens once the presale ends.\\nHead to the website to buy $STARS with ETH, USDT, BNB, or even by card.\\nFollow Crypto All-Stars on social media – X (Twitter) | Telegram to stay up-to-date on all the developments.\",\n",

Reaching a second all-time high (ATH), Bitcoin's price climbed to $76,029 (roughly Rs. 64.14 lakh) on global exchanges, according to CoinMarketCap. Over the past 24 hours, BTC's value has risen by more than two percent worldwide. On Indian exchanges like CoinDCX and CoinSwitch, BTC is trading above $76,875 (approximately Rs. 64.8 lakh) as of Friday, November 8.\\n'Bulls continue to dominate the crypto market owing to the pro crypto expectation from the upcoming regime change in the United States. Late last night the federal reserve of US also announced a rate cut of 25 bps, exactly as the market was expecting with Bitcoin ticking higher post the decision was made,' the CoinSwitch Markets Desk told Gadgets360, explaining the surge.\\nEther saw a price hike of 2.47 percent over the last day. On global exchanges, the asset is trading at $2,910 (roughly Rs. 2.45 lakh). In India, meanwhile, ETH's price reached $2,940 (roughly Rs. 2.47 lakh) as per the crypto price tracker by Gadgets 360. Notably, while Bitcoin achieved two new all-time highs this week, Ethereum remains significantly below its record of $4,878 (roughly Rs. 41,145), last reached in November 2021.\\n'World's second largest crypto by market cap, ETH, too showed some strength as it hit its highest price in more than three months. $3,000 (Roughly Rs. 2.5 lakh) could be a major resistance for Ethereum to cross post which $4,000 (roughly Rs. 3.37 lakh) will be the next target for bulls,' CoinSwitch added.\\nOn Friday, many cryptocurrencies are trading profitably, riding the post-election market momentum. During his campaign, President Trump expressed support for considering Bitcoin as part of the nation's reserve assets and indicated plans to implement policies favorable to the crypto-mining industry.\\nAt the time of writing, Solana, Cardano, Leo, Monero, and Stellar were trading in greens.\\nThe overall crypto market cap rose by 1.35 percent in the last 24 hours. Presently, the crypto market cap stands at 2.15 trillion (roughly Rs. 1,81,39,883 crore), showed CoinMarketCap.\\nOther altcoins like Binance Coin, USD Coin, Dogecoin, Tron, Shiba Inu, and Avalanche are trading sideways.

The rally comes on the heels of two major U.S. events: the election of Republican Donald Trump as president and a 25-basis-point rate cut by the Federal Reserve — both seen as strong bullish signals by market analysts.\\nWeekend price surges are typically considered bullish within the cryptocurrency sector, as trading volumes tend to dip when institutional investors and professional traders step back over Saturdays and Sundays. The reduced liquidity during these times can lead to amplified price swings, where even smaller transactions can produce considerable price shifts.\\nIn this case, the weekend rally may be fueled by retail investors, with analysts suggesting that broader interest from smaller, individual investors — rather than just large institutional players — could signal positive momentum for the crypto market.\\nAccording to a report by CoinDesk, profit-taking among bitcoin traders has been modest compared to previous periods of heightened enthusiasm, implying that the current rally still has room to grow.\\nMeanwhile, bearish traders who bet against Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies suffered notable losses, with more than $280 million in short positions liquidated over the weekend — an unusually high figure. Of these, Bitcoin short bets accounted for $103 million, while Ethereum (ETH) short bets totaled around $70 million. Outside of BTC and ETH, other cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Solana (SOL) also saw significant liquidations, with more than $25 million in futures trades wiped out, indicating a rise in interest for these tokens.\\nLiquidations occur when exchanges forcefully close a trader's leveraged position due to an inability to meet margin requirements. Large-scale liquidations can signal extreme market conditions, often seen during periods of panic selling or intense buying. Such a cascade effect could indicate an impending price reversal, suggesting that the market might be approaching a tipping point following a possible overreaction in sentiment.\",\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'Altcoins simply refer to any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoins. Read on for a deeper dive into altcoins.',\n",
       "   'summary': \"TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Since its creation in January 2009, Bitcoin has become the backbone of the cryptocurrency market—although some argue that the first digital currency may have emerged as early as 1990. Over the past few years, Bitcoin has gradually gained popularity, and other cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin have started joining the market. The latter is what we call an ' altcoin '.\\nAltcoins simply refer to any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoins. They aim to provide alternatives to Bitcoin, offering diverse features and potential advantages.\\nLet's take a look at what altcoins are, taken from Investopedia and Business Insider.\\nWhat is Altcoin?\\nInvestopedia explains that the term 'altcoin' is short for 'alternative coin'. They basically serve as an alternative, including any cryptocurrency and token, to Bitcoin. However, some define altcoins as cryptocurrencies that are not Bitcoin and Ethereum.\\nThe journey of altcoins began in 2011 with the introduction of Namecoin, the first altcoin to enter the market. According to Business Insider, Namecoin was created using the same blockchain engine and code as Bitcoin.\\nFollowing the emergence of Namecoin, a number of altcoins were released, including Ethereum, Chainlink, Aave, Stellar Lumens, Uniswap, PotCoin, and Litecoin.\\nDespite being collectively referred to as altcoins, these cryptocurrencies possess unique characteristics and serve distinct purposes. This is because, as Investopedia elaborates, most altcoins are designed with different visions.\\nThey also use diverse consensus mechanisms to validate transactions, open new blocks, or simply distinguish themselves from Bitcoin (and Ethereum).\\nDifferences Between Bitcoin and Altcoin\\nWhile Bitcoin remains the leader in the cryptocurrency space, altcoins have emerged to fill gaps and introduce new capabilities. Here are some major differences between Bitcoin and altcoins, as highlighted by CNBC and 101 Blockchains:\\na. Purpose\\nBitcoin, the pioneering cryptocurrency, was primarily designed as an alternative to traditional financial systems. It enables secure peer-to-peer transactions and anonymity.\\nIn contrast, altcoins serve a diverse range of purposes. For instance, stablecoins are designed to minimize price volatility.\\nb. Technology\\nBitcoin uses the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm to validate transactions and is powered by blockchain technology. In contrast, altcoins are built on different blockchain networks and can use different consensus algorithms, such as Proof of Stake and Proof of Authority.\\nc. Supply\\nBitcoin, with its limited supply of 21 million coins, has established itself as a scarce digital asset. In contrast, the cryptocurrency market is teeming with thousands of altcoins, as reported by CNBC.\\nd. Popularity\\nBitcoin is inarguably the most popular cryptocurrency, with a massive market capitalization of over US$1 trillion. Conversely, altcoins, as alternative digital currencies, are still striving to gain similar levels of market adoption and valuation.\\nPros and Cons of Altcoins\\nAltcoins, while offering a diverse range of features and functionalities, come with their own set of advantages and drawbacks, depending on the currency and its intended purpose.\\nPros of Altcoins:\\nAltcoins, in general, are said to be the 'improved versions' of cryptocurrency as they were initially built to address the shortcomings of other established cryptocurrencies.\\nAltcoins boast a higher chance of survivability since they have more utilities.\\nThere is a sheer amount of altcoins you can choose from, offering a wide range of functions.\\nCons of Altcoins:\\nAltcoins are still considered to be less popular and have smaller market capitalizations.\\nWith fewer players and less activity in the market, altcoins have thin liquidity.\\nMany altcoins are scams or have lost developer and community interest.\\nGiven the multitude of choices, it is hard to distinguish the specific uses of altcoins from one another.\\nTypes of Altcoins\\nAltcoins come in various forms, with each type offering distinct functions. Citing Investopedia, here are some of the primary categories of altcoins:\\na. Stablecoins\\nThe primary function of stablecoins is to reduce volatility by pegging their value to another asset. Tether's USDT and USD Coin (USDC) are among the notable examples of stablecoins.\\nb. Payment Token\\nPayment tokens are used as currency to exchange value between parties. Bitcoin is a type of payment token since it serves the same function.\\nc. Utility Tokens\\nThese altcoins grant users access to services or products within a network. Filecoin, for instance, allows users to purchase storage space on a decentralized network.\\nd. Meme Coins\\nAs the name implies, meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are inspired by internet memes or cultural phenomena. They gain popularity rapidly and are typically utilized for short-term purposes.\\ne. Security Tokens\\nRegulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, security tokens represent fundraising efforts/ownership or tokenized assets that are built to act as securities.\\nf. Governance Tokens\\nGovernance tokens are considered to be utility tokens, but they specifically function to allow holders certain rights within a blockchain, like voting for changes to protocols.\",\n",
