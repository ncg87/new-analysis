# new-analysis
With this research project I hope to explore the possibility of using LLM's, more explicitly an ensemble of existing LLM's, to analyze news articles to determine the application to financial models. I already have some previous experience using prompts to analyze data so I know that the possibility is there, I hope to gain access to the newcatcher Python API, which will help me leverage the large database of news articles to see if this can be applied to the financial and more.
